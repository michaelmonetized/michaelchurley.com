const NAARCHY_CONTENT = `# I put a Dynamic Island on Linux

Droppy is Mac-only. NotchNook is Mac-only. My 16" M1 Pro is running Omarchy. The camera hole was sitting there doing nothing.

So I built **[Naarchy](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy)**. Native GTK4. Hyprland layer-shell. MIT. Not Electron.

The idle island is **370×67** because that is the hole, measured on 3456×2234 at scale 1. When a timer is running it hangs **72px** with ears so the countdown sits on the glass, not in the webcam.

![Timer wrapping the camera](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy/main/docs/screenshots/v0.3/strip-timer-live.jpg)

## The island is the product

Hover the top edge. A black glass card grows out of the notch. Timer on the left, media on the right, a dock underneath. Clicks only land on the capsule and the dock. Everything else at the top of the screen stays yours. That is \`set_input_region\`, not a slogan.

![Home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy/main/docs/screenshots/v0.3/panel-home.jpg)

The timer is a ruler. Scrub it. Let go. It starts. Click to pause. Click again to resume. When it hits zero the whole display strobes and an alarm loops until you click the flash, hit a key, or dismiss. The first version of that fire check was \`remaining == 0 && running()\`. \`running()\` requires remaining > 0. Dead code. It fires now.

## Drop a file anywhere on it

GTK4 file managers send \`GdkFileList\`, not a \`text/uri-list\` string. We were listening for the string. Drops felt like they only worked on Inbox because that's the only tab that *looked* like a drop zone.

Every tab accepts files now. Hold a file over the island and a dotted **Drop to Inbox** overlay fades in. Release and it jumps you to Inbox with a thumbnail grid.

![Inbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy/main/docs/screenshots/v0.3/panel-inbox.jpg)

Collapsed, you get a stacked pile of the latest thumbs and a count. Timer still wins if one is running.

![Collapsed file pile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy/main/docs/screenshots/v0.3/strip-files.jpg)

## The rest

Clipboard history with search and pin. Calendar with ICS feeds, Meet/Zoom join, and "leave at 9:23." Volume and brightness HUDs. Omarchy theme follow.

No telemetry. Socket is \`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/naarchy.sock\`, mode 600.

## Install

\`\`\`bash
sudo pacman -S --needed gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell rust
git clone https://github.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy
cd naarchy
cargo install --path . --locked
systemctl --user enable --now naarchy.service
\`\`\`

const OMADESIGN_CONTENT = `![omadesign welcome screen — Make something, 52 templates, New document presets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omadesign/master/media/design.jpg)

## Who

I design on Linux now. Omarchy. Asahi. The camera hole has Naarchy. The creative suite did not make the move.

Adobe stayed on the other OS. Affinity is partial. Browser tools are tabs that die when the laptop sleeps. Electron "studios" burn RAM and still feel like a website with a window chrome.

omadesign is for the operator who already lives in a themed Linux desktop and refuses to open four apps to finish one mark. Designers leaving macOS. Photographers who want LibRaw without leaving the seat. Brand freelancers who carry palettes and type roles as files, not screenshots in Slack.

If you build MarTech, ship local tools, or just want \`cargo\` and a tarball instead of a Creative Cloud invoice — that is the room.

## What

I built a native Rust studio. \`eframe\` / egui. Not GTK. Not Electron.

Four personas share one document and one layer stack: **Design** (vector), **Pixel** (paint/retouch), **Photo** (RAW develop), **Motion** (timeline → animated SVG / Lottie). Geometry is defined once. Drawn for the live canvas and for PNG/SVG export. Mutations go through \`Cmd\` + \`History\`.

![Design persona — Block Party poster, rotated color block at 19°, Inspect panel](https://michaelmonetized.github.io/omadesign/media/showcase/design.webp)

Current version is **0.0.4-alpha** — "The handles got the memo." aarch64 and x86_64 \`*-unknown-linux-gnu\` tarballs on GitHub Releases. Linked against **glibc 2.35**. Phosphor Light icons. Omarchy theme colors and \`fontconfig\` / \`omarchy font current\`. Max as the default face.

Fifty-two editable vector templates. Brand kits travel as \`.omacolors\`, \`.omatype\`, \`.omabrand/\`. Photo side: LibRaw for DNG/CR2/CR3/NEF/ARW/RAF, 16-bit linear source, \`.omaphoto\` sidecars, \`.omapreset\` looks, folder batch. Motion: thirteen presets, Lottie JSON with unsupported-feature reporting.

Interop is boring on purpose — PSD/PSB, PDF, AI-compatible PDF, OpenRaster, SVG/SVGZ, optional Affinity bridge, native \`.oma\`. CLI \`--inspect\` / \`--convert\`. MIT. Copyright 2026 Michael C Hurley.

![Photo persona — Coast at golden hour, Develop Color panel, Place in Design](https://michaelmonetized.github.io/omadesign/media/showcase/photo.webp)

## Where

It runs where I run: Asahi Omarchy, Arch-class ARM, anything glibc 2.35 or newer. Same binary story on x86_64 via zig cross-compile — local release builds, uploaded by hand. No GitHub Actions bill.

Repo: [michaelmonetized/omadesign](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omadesign). Studio site on Pages: [michaelmonetized.github.io/omadesign](https://michaelmonetized.github.io/omadesign/). Manual under \`/docs/manual/\`.

![Repo layout — assets, docs, examples, media, remotion, scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omadesign/master/media/mark.png)

On this machine the binary is \`~/.local/bin/omadesign\` → \`omadesign 0.0.4-alpha\`. Install one-liner lives in \`scripts/install-remote.sh\`. The audience sits next to the Omarchy / Asahi tribe and the indie builders who already read Cargo.toml before they read the landing page.

![Motion persona — After Hours listening room, timeline keyframes, Make it move presets](https://michaelmonetized.github.io/omadesign/media/showcase/motion.webp)

## When

**2026-08-26.** Spike as "Atelier v0.1" — Rust + egui all-in-one. Prove the canvas before naming the product.

**2026-08-28.** Rename to omadesign. glibc 2.35 link. Canvas handles, pen, live type, zoom-to-box. Phosphor + desktop theme. First lander and docs.

**2026-08-29.** fontconfig enumeration, Google Fonts on demand, Max default. Palettes. Compound paths. Shape and asset browsers. Zig cross-compile for x86_64. Remotion hero. GPU texture reuse. First alpha-rc tags.

**2026-09-02–03.** Motion timeline, Lottie, welcome that fits. QA pass on the early user-test list.

**2026-09-05.** Precision guides, masks, healing. Fifty-two templates. Shortcut HUD. Portable brand libraries. Pen/type/logo film. Website rebuild — Catppuccin, studio tour, real recordings.

**2026-09-06.** v0.0.1-alpha packages verified. Layered interop. Camera RAW. v0.0.2-alpha same day.

**2026-09-07.** Selection and layer QA. Photo batch + presets → v0.0.3-alpha. Rotated node editing and context-menu flips → v0.0.4-alpha.

**2026-09-08.** Sixty-eight commits from init. Four tagged alphas. Same-day docs experiment: a scoped First-File Setup offer went up and came back down; CHANGELOG keeps the record, app and license never changed.

Thirteen days. That is the clock.

![omadesign mark — geometric design wordmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omadesign/master/media/mark.png)

## Why

Linux got my daily driver. The design suite did not. That gap is the whole reason.

I wanted one seat: vector precision, paint, RAW, light motion — without renting four subscriptions or babysitting an Electron process. I wanted the chrome to follow *my* desktop colors and fonts, not a baked orange skin. I wanted releases I can rebuild on the machine that ships them.

So I linked glibc 2.35, zig-cross-compiled x86_64, uploaded tarballs with SHA-256, and kept shipping alphas until the handles behaved on rotated nodes. Operator stack. Own the toolchain. Build in public.

omadesign is still alpha — advanced text layout, symbols, collab, PDF/X + CMYK are on the roadmap, not in the tarball. Affinity write is not there. RAW varies by camera. That is fine. The document model works. The personas share a layer stack. The downloads exist for ARM64 and x86_64 today.

If you moved to Linux and your creative suite stayed behind, you already know the hole I was staring at.

What would you put in the first \`.oma\` file if you sat down on a fresh Omarchy box tonight?

const NAARCHY_04_COVER =
  "/blog/naarchy-0-4-preferences-privacy/cover.png";

const NAARCHY_04_CONTENT = `After the [Sep 3 island post](https://www.michaelchurley.com/blog/naarchy-linux-dynamic-island), I hardened Naarchy locally to **0.4.0** — native Preferences, \`naarchy doctor\`, atomic stores, travel opt-in, IPC cleanup. Validated on three machines. **Not pushed / not tagged yet.** GitHub tip remains **v0.3.3**.

![Naarchy 0.4 Home — Focus Timer and Now Playing, gear for Preferences](/blog/naarchy-0-4-preferences-privacy/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

This one is for people already living in the island — Omarchy / Hyprland operators who installed Naarchy after the Sep 3 post and started trusting it with clipboard history, file drops, and calendar feeds.

If you care whether state files are written atomically, whether the socket is mode 0600, whether travel estimates ask before they phone Nominatim, and whether \`doctor\` can tell you the session is sane without opening a GUI — you are the audience.

Builders who ship local-first GTK tools. Multi-machine QA types who refuse to call a release “done” until it runs on more than the laptop that authored it.

Not for anyone still deciding whether Linux needs a notch overlay. That story is already live. This post assumes you know what Naarchy is.

## What

Local tip is **0.4.0**. GitHub tip is still **v0.3.3**. Say that out loud before anything else.

0.4 is the overhaul I validated on September 5 and have been running since — Preferences window, reduced motion, \`naarchy --version\`, read-only \`naarchy doctor\`, stricter CLI rejection, atomic clipboard/Inbox/Home state, feature-gated services, travel estimates behind an explicit opt-in, IPC/CLI cleanup, CI that drafts releases with checksums. Roughly fifty-one files, +4937/−4096 against \`origin/main\` @ \`ef9cf87\`. Uncommitted. Unpushed. No \`v0.4.0\` tag.

![Clipboard 0.4 — newest-first history, pin, Clear history, gear for Preferences](/blog/naarchy-0-4-preferences-privacy/screenshots/clipboard.png)

Concrete deltas that matter day-to-day:

- **Native Preferences.** Gear opens a bounded floating window for appearance, motion, behavior, and feature controls. Advanced bits stay in \`~/.config/naarchy/config.toml\`. Appearance reloads live; feature flags and calendar feeds still want a restart.
- **\`naarchy doctor\`.** Read-only desktop check — Wayland, Hyprland, session bus, daemon, config, timer sound, volume/brightness HUD detection. On this box it prints nine OKs and points at the config path.
- **IPC honesty.** Second process talks JSON over \`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/naarchy.sock\` (mode 0600), waits for a bounded ack that the command entered the queue — not that the UI finished. Single-instance lock. Malformed durations exit 2.
- **Privacy pass.** No telemetry (unchanged). Clipboard + shelf stay owner-only on disk; history is still **not encrypted** while capture is on — disabling Clipboard stops the watcher. Travel estimates (Nominatim / IPinfo|ipapi / OSRM) require opt-in. Clear Inbox does not delete originals. Duplicate drops rejected. Corrupt JSON gets a backup instead of a silent wipe.
- **Atomic stores.** Clipboard, Inbox, and Home preferences write privately and atomically. Failed write keeps previous state.
- **Perf sample (directional, 8s):** collapsed CPU 0.125% → below sample; expanded 0.625% → 0.375%; RSS roughly flat (~82→84 MiB collapsed, ~102→101 MiB expanded) vs installed 0.3.3.
- **86 Rust tests.** fmt, Clippy \`-D warnings\`, debug + opt builds, smoke. Fixed a GTK 4.22.4 crash disposing a never-realized hidden window during monitor hotplug / prefs rebuild.

Battery widget is already gone as of 0.3.3 — bar shows %, \`hud battery\` remains. 0.4 does not bring it back.

![Widgets 0.4](/blog/naarchy-0-4-preferences-privacy/screenshots/widgets.png)

![Calendar 0.4](/blog/naarchy-0-4-preferences-privacy/screenshots/calendar.png)

## Where

Same seat: Asahi Omarchy / Hyprland on the 16" M1 Pro (\`m1pro16\`), plus QA on \`hpeliteclient\` and \`intelpro\`. Local binary: \`naarchy 0.4.0\` via \`~/.cargo/bin\`. Local aarch64 dist archive exists under \`target/release/dist/\` with SHA256SUMS; that archive wants **glibc 2.39+**. Public GitHub Releases are still the 0.3.3 tarballs until push + remote CI succeed.

Repo: [michaelmonetized/naarchy](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/naarchy). Origin story (Sep 3): [Naarchy: a Dynamic Island for Linux that owns the notch](https://www.michaelchurley.com/blog/naarchy-linux-dynamic-island).

\`doctor\` on the machine that wrote this draft:

\`\`\`
Naarchy 0.4.0 · desktop check

OK    Wayland session
OK    Hyprland integration
OK    Session bus
OK    Daemon
OK    Configuration
OK    File opening
OK    Timer sound
OK    Volume HUD detection
OK    Brightness HUD detection
\`\`\`

## When

**2026-09-03.** Shipped 0.3.0–0.3.3 and published the island post. GitHub tip froze at \`ef9cf87\` / tag \`v0.3.3\`.

**2026-09-05 (local).** 0.4.0 overhaul + \`docs/VALIDATION.md\`. Native prefs, doctor, atomic state, travel opt-in, IPC/CLI refactor. Desktop checks: calendar nav, 48h timer, prefs rebuild, 3× monitor hotplug, fullscreen hide/restore, notification queue. Three-machine QA: m1pro16, hpeliteclient, intelpro.

**2026-09-08.** Still running 0.4.0 locally. Still dirty vs \`origin/main\`. Still no public release. This EXTEND draft is the trail for when that push lands — or for saying “RC on my boxes” if the story publishes first.

## Why

The Sep 3 post proved the island. 0.4 is about trusting it with operator data.

I did not want Preferences buried in a TOML file only. I did not want a second process that could hang forever waiting for UI. I did not want travel estimates quietly enriching a calendar event. I did not want a crash when a hidden GTK window got disposed during hotplug. I wanted \`doctor\` to answer “is this session actually wired?” without expanding the panel.

So I hardened the stores, gated the network, measured CPU against 0.3.3, ran eighty-six tests, and installed the same binary on three machines before calling the overhaul validated. Release gates that remain: push, remote GHA with Rust 1.92 pin, sustained everyday use, physical multi-monitor on the targets that matter.

0.4.0 is real on my desktops. It is not on GitHub until I push it. That gap is the whole reason this post exists as an EXTEND, not a rewrite.

If your island already sits in the camera hole — what should \`naarchy doctor\` check next that it does not check today?`;

const GETAT_COVER =
  "/blog/getat-me-relationship-first-link-in-bio/cover.png";

const GETAT_CONTENT = `![GetAt.Me landing — Turn your audience into fans & customers](screenshots/landing.png)

## Who

I kept watching creators and consultants park their whole business behind a vertical stack of blue links.

Linktree-class pages are fine for “here are my URLs.” They are a dead end when someone is ready to book a call, leave a review, ask a question, or pay. That visitor opens five more tabs. Intent cools. The operator never sees the near-miss.

GetAt.Me is for the people who already have attention and need a destination that behaves like a small CRM on a single handle — consultants, service-led shops, solo brands, creators who sell time and trust, not just clicks.

If you build MarTech, ship Clerk + Convex stacks, or just hate bolting Calendly + Typeform + Intercom onto a bio link, you are in the room.

## What

I shipped an interactive landing page at [getat.me](https://getat.me). Claim a handle. Theme it. Drop links. Then unlock the relationship surfaces as you grow.

Stack facts, not pitch deck: **Next.js 16.1.6** (Turbopack) on Vercel, **Convex** for real-time data, **Clerk** for auth and billing (\`has()\` feature gates), Stripe through Clerk Billing, Resend for mail, Sentry + PostHog for the ops trail. Tailwind 4, Radix/shadcn, Phosphor icons. TipTap / markdown editor for posts. \`@dnd-kit\` for link reorder. Package version **0.1.0**. Public repo under HurleyUS.

![Features lander](screenshots/features.png)

Nine themes live in the selector: Mocha, Frappe, Macchiato, Monokai, Tokyo, Tomorrow, One, Rosepine, Dracula. Links reorder by weight. Sections group them. Owners get an analytics dashboard — page views, link clicks, bookings, messages — with PostHog and Convex events that ignore the owner so you do not inflate yourself.

Plans from \`.config/plans.ts\`: Free starter (no card). Premium at $4.99/mo ($3.99 annual). Pro at $9.99 ($7.99). ProMax at $19.99 ($14.99). Pro is where booking, referrals, live chat, and conversion analytics harden. ProMax is payments, custom availability, rich posts with likes/replies/quote reposts/threads, and the verification surfaces.

![Owner profile edit view from the repo](screenshots/profile-edit-view.jpg)

## Where

The product lives on the open web: [getat.me](https://getat.me). Profiles at \`getat.me/{handle}\`. Owner tools under \`/{handle}/dashboard\` and account routes. Marketing shell: features, pricing, FAQ, contact, privacy, terms, plus a small SEO blog cluster comparing link-in-bio options.

Code: [github.com/HurleyUS/getat.me](https://github.com/HurleyUS/getat.me). Topics: \`links\`, \`social\`. Deploy path is Vercel continuous — no GitHub Release tarballs, because this is a hosted SaaS seat, not a desktop binary.

The audience sits next to every creator tool thread that still treats a bio link like a footer.

![Pricing page](screenshots/pricing.png)

## When

**2024-10-27.** Create Next App. Three commits. Then a long quiet.

**2025-10-30.** “forming the profile.” Themes (Tomorrow Night, Mocha/Frappe/Macchiato HSL). Clerk catch-all auth routes. Unlimited links gated through Clerk billing features. Convex provider switched to \`@clerk/nextjs\` so mutations stop lying about “User not found.”

**2025-11.** Ninety-eight commits in one month. Pricing page and PricingTable styling. Centralized plans config. Free / Premium / Pro / ProMax PlanInfo ladder. Features lander. FAQ, contact, footer, privacy, terms. Homepage hero that says the product out loud.

**2026-01-31.** Posts grow a social graph — likes, replies, quote reposts, nested threads for ProMax.

**2026-02.** Analytics dashboard. Click and view tracking for visitors only. Onboarding with live handle availability. Drag-and-drop link reorder. SEO sitemap/robots/manifest. Clerk webhooks for user.updated / user.deleted. Lucide → Phosphor.

**2026-03.** Brand customization with live preview. QR and social share. Link sections. Next.js 16 and the middleware→proxy migration. Demo showcase profiles. SEO blog pages.

**2026-05.** Blacksmith CI gates. Convex/Clerk build fallbacks. Sentry project routing.

**2026-08-08.** \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` on Vercel.

**2026-09-08.** One hundred seventy-seven commits on the clock. PR #43 fixes profile ownership and Clerk billing fulfillment. PR #44 puts Bun on the production build. PR #45 includes the TypeScript packages production installs actually need. HEAD \`0b96e39\`.

That is the journey from empty Next scaffold to a live relationship console with billing that fulfills.

## Why

A bio link that only lists URLs trains your audience to leave. I wanted the stay — book the slot, send the referral, open the chat, leave the rating, pay when the work is ready — without exporting the visitor to a scavenger hunt.

So I put the surfaces on the handle, gated them with Clerk plans, synced them on Convex, and kept shipping until ownership and billing fulfillment stopped being a customer-journey cliff.

It is still 0.1.0. Custom domains and deeper analytics sit on the roadmap. That is fine. The document model for a profile already holds links, bookings, messages, posts, and referrals in one place.

If your current bio link cannot take a booking without opening another product, you already know the hole I was staring at.

What would you put on \`getat.me/yourname\` first — the booking calendar, the live chat, or the three links you actually want people to hit this week?

![OMNUX landing — curl install one-liner](screenshots/landing.png)

![OMNUX truth table — M1/M2 shipping, M3 experimental, M4 bring-up, M5/M6 nothing public](screenshots/truth-table.png)

## Who

I run Linux on Macs. Omarchy. Asahi. The camera hole already has Naarchy. The install story for “buy an M3 in the store and walk out on Hyprland” did not.

Upstream Asahi did the science. Caution is correct for a research project. Operators who want Omarchy-class polish still hit a wall of half-truths: installers that whisper “coming soon,” GPU claims without pixels, M4 rows that pretend ADT dumps are optional.

Omnux is for the person who already lives on Apple Silicon or is about to, and who wants the frontier packaged — with a truth table that wins when marketing loses. M1/M2 daily drivers. M3 experimental owners who will share traces. Contributors and agents grinding DCP and AGX against real metal. Builders who read STEERING before the landing page.

If you file issues with receipts and refuse vaporware, that is the room.

## What

I stood up an integration-first umbrella: **omnux**.

Not a mega-fork that absorbs the world. A monorepo that coordinates docs, steering, and component wiring. Kernel work lives in \`linux/\` on an \`omnux\` branch. Boot stack in \`m1n1/\`. Installer in the asahi-installer track. Packages in PKGBUILDs. GPU attempt in \`omnux-gpu\` under MIT — clean-room, hardware-trace driven, and honest that nothing is “working” until DRM render nodes exist on a physical M3.

![omnux monorepo layout — linux, m1n1, installer, pkgs, gpu, docs](screenshots/monorepo.png)

One sentence of north star from GOAL.md: a person walks into an Apple Store, buys an M3 MacBook, and walks out running Omnux — Omarchy’s Hyprland desktop on Asahi’s foundation — with everything working, installed without a single manual step.

That sentence is not true yet. The definition of done is a checklist: install, boot, display, GPU, power, input, connectivity, audio, desktop meta package, recovery stick. M0 Foundation is checked. M1 “M3 installs are boring” is next. GPU acceleration is the moonshot long pole.

Install today from macOS or recoveryOS:

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/asahi-installer/omnux/scripts/bootstrap-omnux.sh | sh
\`\`\`

![Install one-liner — curl bootstrap-omnux.sh](screenshots/install-command.png)

M1/M2: daily-drivable, full acceleration on the Asahi baseline. M3: experimental track, \`OMNUX_EXPERIMENTAL\`, software rendering until the GPU and proper DCP land — NVMe, WiFi, Bluetooth, keyboard/trackpad, audio paths already in the working column. M4: bring-up patches ahead of upstream; blocked on physical ADT dumps. M5/M6: nothing public exists; September 22, 2026 customer availability is the earliest realistic dump date for the August 25 lineup.

Sibling tooling: **omnux-report** — one command, offline-capable, consent + redaction, \`.tar.zst\` + SHA256. Validated on a real M1 Pro Omarchy box. SEP evidence collector added without scooping keys or biometrics. Live USB story: **omarchy-mx-mac-iso** S4 installer pipeline verified on loopback (plain + LUKS2, 51 assertions); hardware USB boot still open.

STEERING is non-negotiable: truth is a feature, upstream first, integration not fabrication, local CI on own metal, MIT where we wrote it, user owns the machine, fire with receipts.

Landing / truth table: [michaelmonetized.github.io/asahi-installer](https://michaelmonetized.github.io/asahi-installer/).

## Where

It lives where Apple Silicon owners actually sit — and where the signed boot chain forces honesty.

First install is still recoveryOS or macOS. Apple Silicon does not boot PC-style ISOs from cold. A USB stick becomes bootable after Linux is on internal storage. We track direct-USB-boot work; we do not pretend it shipped.

Repo: [michaelmonetized/omnux](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux). Landing and truth table on Pages: [michaelmonetized.github.io/asahi-installer](https://michaelmonetized.github.io/asahi-installer/). GPU siege issues on [omnux-gpu](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux-gpu). Diagnostics: [omnux-report](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux-report).

On this machine the clone is \`/home/michael/Projects/omnux\` at \`9b5e80d\`. Builds and releases are meant to run on maintainer metal via Makefile + installer \`build-local.sh\` — no hosted Actions gatekeeper. Audience sits next to the Omarchy / Asahi tribe and anyone who already treats a SUPPORT matrix as sacred text.

## When

**2026-08-25.** Monorepo init. README, GOAL, ROADMAP, STEERING, build targets. Submodules wired: kernel, m1n1, installer, pkgs, gpu. Same day Apple announces Mac mini M6/M5 Pro and Mac Studio M5 Max/Ultra — installer gate gains explicit M6 messaging; status snapshot notes September 22 as earliest ADT dump date. MX Mac live installer S4 lands in code with the asahi mkinitcpio hook fix that would have shipped every install without WiFi/GPU firmware. M3 GPU siege plan drafted; seventeen public issues filed. Announcement drafts get the marketing language stripped out.

**2026-08-26.** omnux-report linked and validated at v0.1.0 — complete redacted bundle on M1 Pro Omarchy, ten fixture checks green. Founder rewrite of the announcement; agent-army mandate recorded in GOAL (DHH / Omarchy community: deploy agents, owners share telemetry). TouchID confirmed on Omarchy for T1-chip TouchBar Macs by @0xBOYD3 — first known Linux TouchID. SEP research program filed across omnux-gpu issues; report grows a \`sep/\` collector.

**2026-08-27.** SEP enablement frontier verified from first principles against apstrand/m2-air-touchid work: \`apple_sep\` can bind, firmware stages, and still the AP cannot start the halted SEP — \`CPU_CONTROL\` read-as-zero, write-ignored. Lever is firmware / boot-policy, not a tidy Linux driver patch. Biometric \`stac\` reverse-engineering remains the multi-year wall. Sixteen commits from init to HEAD. Progress log closed the week with receipts.

Three days of foundation. That is the clock so far.

![August 25–27 shipped snapshot](screenshots/progress-snapshot.png)

## Why

Asahi proved locked silicon is not impossible silicon. Upstream moves at the speed of caution. I needed a shipping lane that compresses time-to-user for every public patch — and a voice that refuses to call software rendering a desktop.

I wanted the truth table to beat the press release. I wanted M3 owners to install with eyes open: experimental, hot, battery-hungry until GPU and DCP land — and still useful for traces. I wanted diagnostics owners control, a live stick path rehearsed on loopback before metal, and a GPU project that stays MIT so upstream can take everything.

So the umbrella exists. The curl bootstrap exists. The seventeen-issue siege map exists. The report produces a tarball with a SHA256. TouchID on T1 is celebrated without pretending M-series SEP is solved.

Omnux is still early — M3 installs are not boring yet, Hyprland is not hardware-accelerated on M3, USB hardware boot is unverified, M4 needs ADTs nobody has dumped into our tree. That is fine. The steering holds. The receipts link. The silicon generations are labeled honestly.

If you bought the Mac for the metal and stayed for the desktop, you already know which row of the truth table you are standing on.

const SLOPOPS_CONTENT = `![slopops hero — fleet tab in the ops popup beside the one-icon five-tabs card](screenshots/app.png)

## Who

I run a small fleet and a loud SaaS stack. Tailscale peers. Vercel production. Sentry unresolved. PostHog events. GitHub issues assigned to me.

That used to mean five browser tabs I leave open like a superstition. Refresh. Squint. Miss the deploy that went ERROR while I was in a terminal.

slopops is for the Omarchy operator who already lives in the bar and refuses another Electron tray for the same five APIs. Solo builders. MarTech people who ship on Vercel and still SSH into boxes. Anyone who already typed \`gh auth login\` once and does not want a sixth personal access token living in a random JSON file under \`~/Library\`.

If your morning starts with “is the fleet up, did prod deploy, what is screaming in Sentry” — that is the room.

## What

I built an Omarchy **bar-widget**. QML. Quickshell. Id \`slopops\`. Display name SlopOps. Version **0.1.0**. Category Monitoring. One instance. Default section: right.

One icon. Nerd Font server glyph. Tiny badge dot in the corner.

![Fleet tab — peers, online count, ts / 22 / 5900 / t3 status lights](screenshots/fleet.png)

Five tabs in a 620×450 popup:

**Fleet** — every device on the tailnet. Online count. TCP probes for whatever ports you configure (default \`22,5900\`). Optional \`t3Port\` (default 3773) lights green when t3 serve is reachable on that peer’s tailnet IP.

**Deploys** — Vercel projects sorted by most recent production deploy. Anything with an ERROR since the last good deploy gets pinned to the top in pink. You see the fire before you open the dashboard.

![Deploys tab — failing projects pinned above READY rows](screenshots/deploys.png)

**Sentry** — unresolved issues, last 24 hours, grouped by project, loudest first. A \`+ issue\` button runs \`promote.sh\`: open a GitHub issue in \`issueRepo\` with event count, level, culprit, and the Sentry URL, then \`notify-send\`.

**Traffic** — PostHog all-time event total, a 30-day daily series, per-project totals down the side.

**Issues** — \`gh search\` for open issues and PRs for you (or a configured \`ghOwner\`).

![Sentry tab — unresolved 24h groups with + issue promote](screenshots/sentry.png)

The badge is the whole point when the popup is closed. Red if deploy errors or Sentry events. Yellow if tokens are missing or peers are offline. Green if nominal. \`status.sh\` rolls that up. Timer defaults to 90 seconds. Right-click the icon to refresh everything.

Data plane is boring on purpose: bash scripts print JSON; QML \`Process\` parses a line. Tokens sit in \`secrets.env\` (gitignored, chmod 600). Missing a token does not crash the tab — it shows a hint and moves on. GitHub never needed a token in that file; it uses your existing \`gh\` login.

Settings are widget keys, not forks: \`omarchy bar set slopops fleetPorts "22,5900,3389"\`, \`sentryOrg\`, \`sentryUrl\` for self-hosted, \`posthogUrl\` for EU, \`vercelTeamId\`, \`issueRepo\`, \`t3Port 0\` to hide the t3 light.

![PostHog traffic tab — all-time total, 30-day bars, per-project counts](screenshots/traffic.png)

## Where

It runs where Omarchy’s bar runs — Quickshell on the desktop I already stare at. Plugin path on this machine: \`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/slopops\`. Same tree mirrored under the dotfiles-omarchy project copy.

Repo: [michaelmonetized/slopops](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/slopops). Public. Branch \`master\`. No Pages homepage. No GitHub Release tag. Linguist says mostly QML, then Shell, a little JavaScript helper for \`ago\` / \`fmt\` / \`levelColor\`.

![Repo layout — Ops.qml, tabs, scripts, secrets example](screenshots/repo-structure.png)

The audience sits next to Omarchy, Tailscale, Vercel, Sentry, and PostHog — the people who already have those CLIs and tokens, not the people who need a demo video of what a deploy is.

![Issues tab — open issues and PRs via gh search](screenshots/issues.png)

## When

**2026-08-26, 9:23 AM Eastern.** First commit. Message: \`michael.ops 0.1.0: multi-service ops bar panel for Omarchy\`. Twenty files. 1,780 lines. The whole panel lands in one shot — \`Ops.qml\`, five tabs, seven scripts, manifest, README, \`secrets.env.example\`.

**Same morning, 9:55 AM Eastern.** Second commit. \`rename plugin id to slopops\`. Manifest id and name, README, moduleName/ipcTarget. \`michael.ops\` becomes the public name that matches the repo.

**2026-08-26, 1:55 PM UTC.** Last push on GitHub. Still \`0.1.0\`. Still two commits. No LICENSE file in the tree. One star.

**2026-09-08.** Pack day. Plugin still on disk. \`omarchy bar put slopops\` puts it on the bar. \`secrets.env\` is still not created on this machine — the degrade path is the live path until tokens land.

Thirty-two minutes from first commit to rename. That is the clock.

## Why

I was paying the context-switch tax every day. Fleet health in one place. Deploys in another. Sentry in a third. PostHog for “is anyone even using this.” GitHub for the work the errors become.

The bar was already the glance surface. Omarchy already had a widget schema. So I put the stack behind one icon and made the badge tell the truth when I am too busy to open the popup.

Shell fetchers. JSON out. Tokens optional. Promote from Sentry to GitHub without leaving the seat. Ports as settings, not a new plugin fork.

That is the tool I reached for when the dashboards started feeling like chores.

const BESTWNC_COVER =
  "/blog/bestwnc-honest-analytics-local-directory/cover.png";

const BESTWNC_CONTENT = `![BestWNC homepage — Find the places that make Western North Carolina feel local](screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I live in the Blue Ridge ops lane. Locals need a directory that feels like a map, not a lead-gen trap. Owners need a page they can claim without a sales call. Operators need dashboards that do not invent click-through rates.

BestWNC is for people hunting restaurants, coffee, contractors, wellness, and shops from Asheville to Boone — and for the owners of those places who will list free, claim if we already seeded them, and upgrade only when reach matters.

If you build MarTech, local SEO products, or Stripe-backed owner tools: this post is the field notes, not a pitch deck.

## What

I shipped a local business directory for Western North Carolina.

Stack on the box: **Next.js 16.2.6**, React 19, **Convex**, **Clerk**, **Stripe**, PostHog, Sentry, Resend, Tailwind v4, Bun, Phosphor icons, Vercel. Repo is private under \`HurleyUS/bestwnc.com\`. Site is public at [bestwnc.com](https://www.bestwnc.com/).

![Owners lander — Add or claim your BestWNC page in minutes](screenshots/owners.png)

Listings start free. Paid plans live in code — \`lib/billing.ts\` — not as a fragile Stripe Dashboard catalog:

- **Unlimited** — $10/mo or $80/yr — photos, video, posts, events, widgets, social links, contact, messaging
- **Featured** — $50/mo or $480/yr — Unlimited plus priority / pinned placement
- **Max** — $100/mo or $960/yr — Featured plus ad credits and the top tooling tier

Manual add-ons stay manual until fulfilled: Online Presence Analysis $8, Vetted Badge $80, Listing Sync $480. Dynamic checkout builds the price at session time.

Seed data is 101 real WNC businesses — Asheville-heavy, plus Waynesville, Brevard, Hendersonville, Black Mountain, and the rest of the corridor. Claim if we already have you. Add if we do not.

The part that matters this week: **analytics honesty**. Owner analytics used to look busier than the measurement layer could defend. On September 8 I changed the API and UI so recorded cumulative views, review count, and average rating stay; period views, clicks, conversion rates, and weekly series return **\`null\`** with an explicit \`availability\` object. README says the same thing out loud. Cumulative views include repeat, owner, and bot traffic — they are not unique visitors. \`null\` is the product.

Same two days: ownership claims and billing hardened, unsupported sales claims stripped from marketing surfaces, Stripe webhooks allowed through session middleware when signed, and honeypot fields on every public contact / newsletter form because spam was flooding Advertising and General Inquiry. Fill the hidden field → silent success, no email, no lead row.

![Owner plans — Free, Unlimited, Featured](screenshots/pricing.png)

## Where

It runs on Vercel against Convex. Auth is Clerk. Money is Stripe. Mail is Resend. Errors go to Sentry. Product events go to PostHog.

Surfaces that matter:

- Public discovery — explore, categories, cities, top-rated, trending, search, business pages
- Owner funnel — \`/owners\`, \`/claim\`, \`/add-business\`, dashboard edit / photos / reviews / analytics / upgrade
- Pricing — \`/pricing\` with the plan cards that match \`PLAN_DEFINITIONS\`

Audience sits in Western North Carolina and with builders who ship local directories instead of another generic “AI growth” wrapper.

![Explore — directory discovery surface](screenshots/explore.png)

## When

**2026-01-08.** Init. Next.js + Convex + Tailwind. Directory MVP the same day.

**January–February.** Categories, seed scripts, Mountain Modern redesign, mobile nav, instant listing (no review queue), Sentry, claim + email verification, PostHog, Schema.org, PWA, design variant lab, Phosphor icons, Stripe checkout/portal/webhook, **101 real WNC businesses**, photo upload via Convex storage, owner dashboard, admin moderation queue.

**March.** Launch-week security and reliability. Env validation that fails fast. Stripe monetization sprint. Dynamic pricing documented. Revenue-ready checklist. Owner plans, billing roles, social tables and signed-in pages.

**April–May.** Listing boosts on the owner dashboard. Real PostHog wiring passes. Blacksmith CI gates. Production deploy prep. Robots set to index, follow.

**2026-09-07.** PR #109 — secure ownership claims and billing; remove unsupported sales claims; keep purchased manual services pending until fulfillment.

**2026-09-08.** PR #110 — report only recorded business analytics (\`null\` where unmeasured). PR #111 — honeypot fields on public contact forms. HEAD \`ae65364\`. Two hundred sixty-one commits on \`main\`.

That is the clock from empty repo to an honest owner dashboard.

![About — BestWNC product story surface](screenshots/about.png)

## Why

Directories lie by default. Fake weekly charts. Fake conversion. Fake “impressions” that never existed as rows.

I refused that for BestWNC. If the counter is cumulative and polluted by owners and crawlers, say so. If period CTR is not instrumented, return \`null\` — not zero dressed as insight.

I also refused a soft claim path and a spam inbox. Claims require verified identity. Billing routes have security tests. Inquiry forms fail closed for bots without giving them a bounce they can learn from.

The product is still a directory: find a place, claim a place, pay for reach when you want it. The operator move is shipping the revenue path and then deleting the metrics theater in the same week.

If you own a shop between Asheville and Boone, what would you fix first on your BestWNC page — photos, hours, or the claim so nobody else can edit it?

const MACKS_COVER =
  "/blog/macks-bbq-shack-canton-condensation-site/cover.png";

const MACKS_CONTENT = `![Mack's Shack homepage — wood nav, shield logo, chalk value prop over pit fire](https://www.macksbbqshack.com/ribs-sack.avif)

## Who

I build for operators. Sometimes that operator is me. Sometimes it is a pit crew on Main Street in Canton, North Carolina.

Mack's Shack BBQ needed a site that looked like the shack — not a generic restaurant theme with stock smoke overlays — and a catering path that dropped leads somewhere durable when Chris was on the line. Guests needed hours, address, phone, and a menu that matched the board on the wall. Planners needed “mouths to feed” and an event date without playing phone tag first.

I am the builder. Hustle Launch is on the footer. The food is theirs. The stack is mine to keep honest.

## What

I shipped a private Next.js 16 App Router site. React 19. Bun. Tailwind 4. Biome. Framer Motion on the hero. Cabin Sketch for chalk. Source Sans for the rest.

The homepage is a condensation-glass hero over looping pit video. Pointer clears fog. Mobile drops the canvas and keeps the video. Wood strip across the nav. Tomato catering CTA. Outline button into the menu board.

![Mack's Shack BBQ logo mark](https://www.macksbbqshack.com/logo.avif)

The menu is a skeuomorphic blackboard — real blackboard texture, wood dividers with inset depth, taped Polaroids for brisket, pork, sides, banana pudding. Item copy lives in one content module so the Schema.org Restaurant JSON-LD and the chalk board drink from the same list. Wings brined, smoked, fried, tossed in Bama white. Mack Sack Combo. Family packs. Pick N Choose by the pound.

Catering is a real form: name, email, phone, event date, mouths-to-feed slider, details. The API writes a Convex \`cateringLeads\` row and fires Resend from \`Mack's Shack Bbq <notify@uncap.us>\` to \`macks.shack.bbq@gmail.com\` (CC me). Contact does the same with \`contactSubmissions\` and a “Message Chris” button next to Chris Lewallen’s photo and a Maps embed. Sentry on the error boundaries. PostHog on the pageviews. Reviews via a Jotform widget that cannot take the page down with it.

![Brisket — bark and smoke ring](https://www.macksbbqshack.com/brisket.avif)

## Where

366 Main St. Canton, NC 28716. Phone 828-631-2520. Hours Fri–Sun 11–7, Monday 12–7.

Canonical URL is [www.macksbbqshack.com](https://www.macksbbqshack.com). Vercel also serves the project alias. Repo is private: [michaelmonetized/macksbbqshack-com](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/macksbbqshack-com).

Footer socials hit Yelp, Instagram, Google Maps, Facebook. Footer credit names Hustle Launch for web design and app development. The audience for *this* write-up is builders who care how a local business site actually captures a wedding headcount — and anyone in WNC who already knows the Main Street pit.

![Pulled pork plate asset from the live site](https://www.macksbbqshack.com/pork.avif)

## When

**2026-05-19.** Init. Condensation glass hero mockup. Mobile video fallback. Same day: live business copy, catering flow, hero refinements, mobile drawer, section photos.

**2026-05-20.** Blackboard background. Wood textures. Hustle Launch footer credit. Hero CTA polish until the catering button went tomato. Chris on the contact page. Maps embed. Contact form + Convex persist. Menu Polaroids. Structured data. Sentry. PostHog. Social icons.

**2026-05-22.** Merge PR #1 from \`dev\`. Deploy prod.

**2026-06-04.** Launch prep. Button fix.

**2026-06-27.** Phone update.

**2026-07-12.** Dirty rice off the board.

**2026-07-13.** SEO and custom error boundaries — twice, because the first pass lied. Google/Jotform reviews on about and the other pages. Script moved to the end of body so it stopped breaking the layout.

**2026-07-29.** Sitewide vacation dialog for the Aug 2–3 closure. Cookie dismiss. Sticky banner.

**2026-08-08.** \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` locked in Vercel headers.

**2026-08-30.** Ten commits titled \`[fix] convex + resend connections\`. HEAD settled. Sixty-seven commits from init. That is the clock.

![Nutter Butter banana pudding — dessert Polaroid source](https://www.macksbbqshack.com/nana-puddin.avif)

## Why

A Main Street BBQ does not need a SaaS lander. It needs the board, the hours, the phone, and a catering form that still works when the dining room is loud.

I wanted the hero to feel wet and hot — condensation over real pit video — and the menu to feel like chalk on wood, not a CMS card grid. I wanted leads in Convex *and* in the inbox from a domain I control (\`notify@uncap.us\`), not a “we will get back to you” void. I wanted Schema.org to carry the same wings and family packs the chalkboard shows.

So I linked the textures, wired the mutations, shipped the vacation banner before the holiday, and kept fixing the Resend path until August 30 stopped yelling. Operator stack. Local business. Own the notify domain.

The repo is still private. The site is live. The Polaroids are still taped to the board.

If you were standing at 366 Main tonight, which section of that chalkboard would you photograph first?

const UNCAP_COVER =
  "/blog/uncap-us-repo-native-social-layer/cover.png";

const UNCAP_CONTENT = `![uncap.us Raycast-style signed-out landing — Your shortcut to shipped work](/blog/uncap-us-repo-native-social-layer/screenshots/landing-raycast.png)

## Who

I ship software for a living. The repo is where the truth should live. It usually does not.

Code sits in GitHub. Launch posts sit in a thread that dies in three days. Design decisions live as screenshots in Slack. Hiring signal is a PDF from last year. CI cost hides in a vendor dashboard. AI review output never becomes part of the project graph.

uncap.us is for maintainers and operators who want that whole graph attached to the repository — not for people who need another place to perform. If you already think in owner/repo, org routes, and what shipped this week, you are the room.

I also wrote the manifesto out loud: open source should not mean every byte is public every minute. Commits and branches are a bad primary primitive. Worktrees as we inherited them are an abomination. Agents and humans deserve a VFS that tracks work as it happens.

## What

I built a repo-native social layer. Live site: www.uncap.us. App version in package.json: 0.2.0. Private product repo under HurleyUS.

README-first repo pages at /:owner/:repo. Organizations that own repos. Issues and PRs. Explore. Dashboard. A Lens feed for launches, releases, jobs, design updates, and links tied to the project (Lens replaced the earlier wall naming). Pricing and docs. A downloadable Uncap CLI (UnGit) with device-flow login.

![README-first repository home from launch gallery](/blog/uncap-us-repo-native-social-layer/screenshots/repo-home.png)

Origin sync connects public Git origins (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, Forgejo, Gitea), caches shape, and reads files on demand. Native Uncap-hosted Git remotes are a separate rollout; empty states say that out loud instead of faking clone URLs.

The CLI is the manifesto as a tool. uncap watch auto-tracks. Snapshots and virtual worktrees. Visibility flags for private/staging/public artifacts. Maintainer commands cover issues, pull requests, and continuous integration.

Backend is Convex with Clerk auth.

Stack at HEAD includes TanStack Start, Vite, pnpm, React 19, Convex, Clerk. Production deploys as tanstack-start on Vercel. That replaced an earlier Next.js plus Bun era; README badges lag the real stack.

![Origin code browser from launch gallery](/blog/uncap-us-repo-native-social-layer/screenshots/repo-code.png)

## Where

Production is public even though the GitHub repo is private: www.uncap.us. Health at /api/health reports Clerk, Convex, PostHog, Resend, Sentry, and Stripe ready, with origin imports, native Git refs capability flags, and production telemetry enabled — verified 2026-09-08.

Local clone on this machine: /home/michael/Projects/uncap.us @ ce53c96. CLI install assets under /cli. Brand kit under public/ including the u mark.

The audience sits next to maintainers who already connect forges, and builders who read MANIFESTO.md before the pricing page.

![Explore — What's shipping today?](/blog/uncap-us-repo-native-social-layer/screenshots/explore.png)

## When

**2026-01-08.** Init: Next.js, Convex, Tailwind. Early product was closer to a job-seeker platform loop than a forge.

**2026-02.** Schema, Clerk auth, onboarding, job matching, then a hard security and auth hardening pass.

**2026-05-04 to 06.** Rebuild as a social forge. Real services. Auth and repository creation.

**2026-05-14 to 15.** Launch pack: screenshots, announcement drafts, runbook, health gates. Target drop May 15, 8:00 AM ET. Positioning locked.

**2026-06-09 to 12.** Full app migration across nine phases. Legacy Next tree deleted. Downloadable CLI with device auth. Origin sync and Convex file cache. GTM integrations at the code layer.

**2026-06-13 to 16.** Terminology: lens and repo. Marketing docs and signed-out home. Commit graph redesign. u mark lands in the brand set.

**2026-08-08.** X-Robots-Tag set to index, follow on Vercel.

**2026-08-30 to 31.** Signed-out landing redesigned like raycast.com. Command palette hero. Your shortcut to shipped work. Mobile signup overflow fixed. Duplicate Log in removed. AI-slop highlight pill removed. HEAD ce53c96. 338 commits from init to that tip.

![Historical May social-forge home from launch assets](/blog/uncap-us-repo-native-social-layer/screenshots/home.png)

## Why

Git hosts optimized for storing files. The work I actually do spills sideways — launches, design versions, hiring signal, review output, deploy state. I wanted the repository to be the hub that holds that graph without turning the feed into performative noise.

I also wanted source control primitives that match how I work now: auto-tracking instead of nagging myself to commit, granular visibility instead of all-or-nothing public, virtual worktrees instead of copying trees by hand for agents.

So uncap.us is live with origin-aware repo pages, Lens, orgs, and a CLI on the site. Native hosted remotes are still a rollout, not a pretend clone button. The frame under the product changed once while shipping stayed continuous.

Eight months. Three product shapes. One domain. The file cabinet was never going to grow the graph I needed.

const OMARCHYSITE_COVER =

const OMARCHYSITE_CONTENT = `![Omarchy hero end plate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omarchy-site-tanstack-start/master/public/assets/images/bg/home/hero-end.jpeg)

## Who

I run Omarchy. Asahi. Hyprland. Quickshell draws the bar. Naarchy sits in the camera hole. The creative suite became omadesign. The public Omarchy site was still a static tree I had forked as omarchy-site.

I ship other properties in TypeScript and TanStack. When the site I point people at does not match the stack I build in, I feel the seam every time I open a PR.

This rewrite is for the operator who already lives on Omarchy and wants install, manual, news, and foundation raise inside a TanStack Start app. Also for anyone evaluating Start on a real content-heavy surface.

I did not invent Omarchy. DHH and Omacom did. I rebuilt the site shell.

## What

Repo on GitHub: michaelmonetized/omarchy-site-tanstack-start
Live vercel.app deploy named after the repo.

Stack is TanStack Start plus Router and React 19.

Also Tailwind v4 and the shadcn UI kit.

Root title stays the Omarchy brand line.

![Tokyo Night](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omarchy-site-tanstack-start/master/public/assets/images/mocks/tokyo-night-preview.webp)

Home plays Quattro first-boot, holds empty sky, then etches the mark.
Below that: foundation raise chart, patrons, menu, themes, Hyprland, Quickshell, plugins.

Manual: 52 chapters as typed modules. News: 16 posts. Install for PC, Intel Mac, and Apple Silicon community builds.
ISO constant is 4.0.2. Import helpers pull HTML from the sibling static site checkout.

![Quickshell bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omarchy-site-tanstack-start/master/public/assets/images/mocks/shell-bar.webp)

Deploy config turns off git auto-deploy for main and master. Ship is deliberate.

## Where

It runs on the Vercel preview URL. OS truth remains omarchy.org and omacom/omarchy.
Import sibling on this machine: Projects/omarchy-site. App clone: Projects/omarchy-site-tanstack-start at d98a362.

![Four-way tiling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omarchy-site-tanstack-start/master/public/assets/images/mocks/navigation-fourway-tiling.webp)

Audience sits next to Omarchy and Asahi people and next to builders already on TanStack Router.

## When

**2026-08-31.** init scaffold.

**2026-09-01.** Landing, layout, shell. Full manual chapters. Rest of site including PC and Mac install. Hero mark and empty sky etch.

**2026-09-02.** Square patrons, 13M raise, Quickshell on home. Three commits on Safari etch. CTAs to install, manual, repo. Nav pinned right.

**2026-09-03.** README plays the desktop walkthrough. Fifteen commits. About three days from scaffold to the URL that still answers.

![Clipboard history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/omarchy-site-tanstack-start/master/public/assets/images/mocks/clipboard-history.webp)

## Why

I needed the Omarchy public face in the same toolchain I use for everything else I ship. Static HTML is fine for the upstream project. My working copy wanted file routes, typed content modules, and a deploy I control.

So I imported the manual and news, wired the raise chart, fixed the etch until Safari stopped lying about the canvas, and left auto-deploy off. The OS stays theirs. The Start app is mine to break and rebuild.

ISO still downloads from omarchy.org. Plugins still live at omarchyplugins.com. This repo is the site rewrite as of September 3, 2026.

const OMNUXGPU_COVER =

const OMNUXGPU_CONTENT = `![OMNUX-GPU — MIT clean-room siege for M3 pixels](/blog/omnux-gpu-mit-clean-room-m3-siege/cover.png)

![Honest state — scaffold only; no working driver](/blog/omnux-gpu-mit-clean-room-m3-siege/screenshots/honest-state.png)

## Who

I am the person who already said the quiet part on the Omnux umbrella post: M3 installs today, software-rendered, and software rendering is not a desktop.

This piece is for a narrower room.

M3 owners who will lend a machine for m1n1 proxyclient captures. Reverse engineers who already know Asahi’s AGX story on M1/M2 and want the T603x/T8122 delta wall documented without contamination. DRM and Mesa people who treat “working” as render nodes plus glmark on metal, not a README adjective. License hawks who care that MIT stays clean before \`src/\` fills. Agent operators grinding capture loops under the same agent-army mandate that sits in Omnux GOAL.

If you need an install one-liner or a diagnostics tarball, that is the sibling posts. If you need the GPU long pole named as a project with acceptance criteria, that is this room.

## What

I stood up **omnux-gpu** — a standalone MIT repo whose entire value proposition is honesty about what is missing.

It is an attempt at a clean-room GPU driver for Apple M3-series silicon. License: MIT. Upstream may take everything; that is the point. The repository holds scaffolding, a research roadmap, tooling stubs, and eventually driver code. It does **not** yet contain a working driver. Nothing here claims otherwise until pixels appear on a physical M3.

![Repo layout — docs, tools, empty src, MIT LICENSE](/blog/omnux-gpu-mit-clean-room-m3-siege/screenshots/repo-layout.png)

Three reverse-engineering walls stand between scaffold and acceleration:

1. **Command processor submission model** — how macOS userspace submits work to AGX firmware on T8122/T603x (differs from M2).
2. **Shader ISA deltas** — M3 brought Dynamic Caching, mesh shaders, hardware ray tracing; instruction encoding moved vs M1/M2.
3. **Firmware interface** — version negotiation, queues, faults against shipping macOS AGX firmware (issues call 14.8.3+ as the field floor).

![Three RE walls — CP submission, ISA deltas, firmware interface](/blog/omnux-gpu-mit-clean-room-m3-siege/screenshots/re-walls.png)

Each wall is only discoverable against real hardware, using m1n1’s proxyclient tracing on a machine booted into macOS with instrumentation. Code written away from the metal is fan fiction.

The method is a loop, not a vibe:

1. **Capture** — target M3 into m1n1 proxyclient from a second USB host; run macOS GPU workloads under \`agx_*\` experiments adapted for newer ABI.
2. **Diff** — compare to known M1/M2 models; land deltas in \`docs/\`.
3. **Implement** — clean-room sources in \`src/\` from documented behavior only.
4. **Validate** — kexec Omnux kernel with the driver; iterate until DRM render nodes exist and glmark runs.
5. **Publish** — every milestone upstream to Asahi first.

![Method loop — Capture Diff Implement Validate Upstream](/blog/omnux-gpu-mit-clean-room-m3-siege/screenshots/method-loop.png)

Fifteen public issues map the siege. Issues #1–#8 are the GPU spine: capture harness, submission-model docs, ISA delta docs, firmware-interface docs, DRM skeleton (probe + firmware load + first render node **without** claiming acceleration), Mesa Honeykrisp/agx bring-up for G15-class, t603x power/PMP/thermal, and a local validation harness (kexec + glmark2/vkcube → signed JSON, own metal, no hosted CI theater). Issue #9 is the license immune system: \`docs/CLEANROOM.md\`, PR source disclosure, taint procedure — before any non-scaffold code lands. Issues #10–#15 park SEP/TouchID research on the same tracker so the wall is visible; the biometrics frontier and omnux-report evidence collectors are sibling stories, not this one.

\`src/\` is empty on purpose. Contaminated contribution — decompiled Apple code, NDA headers, GPL-mixed paste — poisons the MIT claim. The audit process has to exist before the directory fills.

## Where

It lives where M3 metal and a second USB host can sit on the same desk.

Repo: [michaelmonetized/omnux-gpu](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux-gpu). Parent umbrella wires it as \`gpu/\` under [michaelmonetized/omnux](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux). Diagnostics sibling: [omnux-report](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux-report) — logs, sysinfo, ADT helper, SEP collectors with redaction; useful for evidence, not a substitute for AGX traces.

SoCs in scope: T603x / T8122 class. Capture target: shipping macOS firmware on those chips. Validation target: Omnux kernel kexec’d from m1n1 until \`/dev/dri/renderD*\` appears and the acceptance harness stops lying.

If you have hardware to lend, the README says open an issue — that is the bottleneck, full stop.

## When

**2026-08-24.** Single scaffold commit \`a3b7f74\`: MIT LICENSE, honest README, \`docs/NOTES.md\` placeholder, empty \`src/\`, stub \`tools/\`. Created the repo the day before the Omnux umbrella monorepo week. One commit. That is still the commit graph.

**2026-08-25.** Siege map lands as public issues #1 through #9 while Omnux M0 is getting wired. Capture harness called the critical path. Clean-room audit filed as blocking-by-convention and cheap — do it before code, not after a lawsuit hypothetical.

**2026-08-26 → 2026-08-27.** Issues #10–#15 add the SEP/TouchID research program to this tracker (T1 community win, T2 bridge, omnux-report SEP section, apstrand frontier notes). Useful adjacency. Still zero GPU capture artifacts under \`docs/captures/\`. Still no DRM skeleton. The calendar moved; the metal bottleneck did not.

**2026-09-08.** This pack. Still scaffold. Still fifteen open issues. Still waiting on an M3-class machine in the harness loop.

![Issue map — GPU #1–#8, clean-room #9, SEP adjacency #10–#15](/blog/omnux-gpu-mit-clean-room-m3-siege/screenshots/issue-map.png)

## Why

Omnux can already tell the truth about M3 installs. Truth without a GPU project is a permanent software-render sentence dressed up as roadmap poetry.

I wanted a repo whose license Asahi can absorb without a negotiation. I wanted “working” defined as pixels and scores on metal, not a press sentence. I wanted the three RE walls named so contributors argue about captures instead of vibes. I wanted the clean-room gate written before the first real C file, because MIT is easy to claim and hard to un-poison.

The ask is not stars. The ask is hardware in the capture loop — and issue checkboxes that turn green only when the acceptance criteria say so.

  "/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/cover.png";

const HURLEYUS_CONTENT = `![Hurleyus hero — desktop preview beside Plymouth unlock](/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/screenshots/hero-desktop-unlock.png)

## Who

I run Omarchy as the daily desk. Catppuccin Mocha is already the right palette — soft contrast, blue accent, pink errors, the whole mocha set.

Stock Mocha still looks like everybody else’s laptop.

Hurleyus is for the Omarchy operator who wants Mocha without anonymity. For the Hurley / quattro / rally-art orbit who want the desk to match the brand. For Asahi Mac people who care that the unlock screen and the compiled-in U-Boot splash say the same name as the bar. For theme authors who already learned that shipping Foot or Ghostty palette files inside a theme is how you get a black terminal.

If your Style menu is full of fine defaults and none of them feel like yours — that is the room.

## What

I built an Omarchy **theme package**. Id folder \`hurleyus\`. Display name **Hurleyus**. MIT. Public repo. Branch \`main\`.

![Desktop preview — Mocha chrome over rally wall](/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/screenshots/desktop-preview.png)

**Palette.** \`colors.toml\` is the source of truth. Background \`#1e1e2e\`. Accent \`#89b4fa\`. Omarchy expands that into Foot, Ghostty, Kitty, Alacritty, btop, Chromium, shell chrome. README is blunt: do not ship terminal palette files in the theme. Those files block the templates. You get a black terminal. I have no interest in that support thread.

**Window chrome.** \`hyprland.lua\` — 20px rounding, 20px gaps in and out, Mocha active/inactive borders. Editors: \`neovim.lua\` points LazyVim at Catppuccin; \`vscode.json\` names the Catppuccin Mocha extension. Icons: Yaru-purple.

![Repo layout — colors, lua, walls, branding, unlock](/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/screenshots/repo-structure.png)

**Walls.** Seven 4K JPEGs, 3840×2160, pre-darkened so the bar and terminals stay readable. Titles in the gallery: Canyon run, Hairpin, The jump, Donuts, Tunnel blast, Service park, Last light. Cycle with \`omarchy theme bg next\` or Style → Background.

![Seven pre-darkened 4K Hurleyus walls](/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/screenshots/walls-gallery.png)

**Boot.** \`unlock.png\` for Plymouth / SDDM — set with \`omarchy plymouth set by theme hurleyus\` (same path Lumon uses). Branding ASCII for about + screensaver. Logo PNG. And the Asahi-specific piece: \`branding/install-uboot-logo.sh\` finds the 160×160 8-bit BMP slot inside \`/usr/lib/asahi-boot/u-boot-nodtb.bin\`, writes a patched copy under cache, runs \`update-m1n1\`. The splash that ships in U-Boot becomes Hurleyus.

**Install.** Origin README still shows \`omarchy theme install <url>\`. Pack-day local note (not pushed yet): Omarchy 4.0.2+ treats a nested \`.git\` directory as a stranger theme and drops \`hyprland.lua\` on install. Keep the Lua by cloning into \`~/.local/share/themes/hurleyus\`, symlinking into \`~/.config/omarchy/themes/hurleyus\`, then \`omarchy theme set hurleyus\`. A symlink counts as yours. A submodule’s \`.git\` *file* also keeps the Lua.

![Install path that keeps hyprland.lua on Omarchy 4.0.2+](/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/screenshots/install-path.png)

## Where

It lives where Omarchy themes live — \`~/.config/omarchy/themes/hurleyus\` on the machine I actually use. Same tree is the git checkout of [michaelmonetized/omarchy-hurleyus-theme](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omarchy-hurleyus-theme).

Boot path is Plymouth / SDDM for unlock, and Asahi’s \`u-boot-nodtb.bin\` for the early splash. No Pages marketing site. No GitHub Release tag. Linguist is mostly the U-Boot install shell plus a little Lua; the walls are the byte mass.

Audience sits next to Omarchy, Catppuccin, Asahi / Omnux Mac desks, and the quattro / Hurley brand lane — people who already know Style → Theme, not people who need a tutorial on what a wallpaper is.

![Boot unlock preview](/blog/hurleyus-omarchy-catppuccin-rally-theme/screenshots/unlock-preview.png)

## When

**2026-08-21, 7:57 PM Eastern.** First commit. \`Fork stock Omarchy Catppuccin into Hurleyus.\` Twenty files. Mocha \`colors.toml\`, hyprland/neovim/vscode/icons, six PNG walls, branding ASCII, preview, MIT, README.

**Same night, 8:09 PM Eastern.** Twelve minutes later. \`Add Hurleyus unlock screen and Asahi U-Boot splash.\` Unlock assets, BMPs, \`install-uboot-logo.sh\`.

**2026-08-22, 6:36 AM Eastern.** \`init\` — wall refresh, bigger about/screensaver ASCII, hyprland tweak.

**2026-08-26, 5:58 AM Eastern.** \`Package for distribution: 4K JPEG walls, README gallery, cleanup.\` PNG walls out. Seven JPEGs in. Gallery in the README. Fat binaries gone so \`theme install\` is not a joke.

Four commits. Still. Last push \`65f4da3\`. Zero stars. Local README has an unpushed install-path rewrite for the 4.0.2+ Lua drop — pack day tells that truth instead of pretending origin already has it.

## Why

Because Mocha was correct and still felt rental.

Because I want one \`colors.toml\` driving the terminals and the rally art carrying the identity — not a fork of every emulator config.

Because on an Asahi Mac the splash in U-Boot is part of the machine’s face, and patching a 160×160 slot is a real receipt, not a settings-app wallpaper picker.

Because Omarchy’s theme system rewards packages that respect templates, and I refuse to relearn the black-terminal lesson.

Fork Thursday night. Unlock and U-Boot twelve minutes later. Slim JPEG distribution five mornings after that. That is the clock.

const REAFERAL_COVER =
  "/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/cover.png";

const REAFERAL_CONTENT = `![Reaferral Inman-style landing — BREAKING referral tracking hero](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I watch real estate agents make a quarter to a third of their income on referrals and still track those deals in spreadsheets, group texts, and vibes.

That is not a CRM problem. That is a **referral accountability** problem. Who sent it. What fee was agreed. What stage the deal is in. Whether the check showed up when it closed.

Reaferral is for licensed agents who are tired of losing money to ambiguity. Solo producers who want a link in the email signature that actually attributes. Team leads who need roles and a shared pipeline. Builders who already speak Next.js, Convex, and Clerk and want the vertical product without another Electron tray.

If your week includes “did that referral ever close” and a half-finished Google Sheet — that is the room.

## What

I built **Reaferral**: an agent-to-agent real estate referral platform.

Stack on the wire: **Next.js 16.1.6** (App Router, Turbopack), **Convex** for the reactive backend, **Clerk** for auth, Tailwind v4, Radix/shadcn-style UI, Recharts, PostHog, Sentry configs, Resend, Stripe Connect routes. Bun monorepo. Workspaces: \`web\` (\`reaferral-web\` 0.1.0) and \`mobile\` (Expo \`reaferral-app\` 1.0.0). Hosted at [reaferral.vercel.app](https://reaferral.vercel.app). GitHub repo private under HurleyUS.

![Features page — product surfaces and mockups](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/features.png)

What ships in the product surface:

**Referral tracking** — create, send, receive; fee percent or flat; status through the deal.

**Trackable links** — short codes under \`/r/[code]\`, click analytics, campaign names.

**Pipeline** — lead → active → under contract → closed (and payout adjacency in schema).

**Teams** — slugs, invites, roles (owner/admin/financial/assistant/member), pending joins that survive signup.

**Messaging** — per-referral threads in Convex.

**Twelve dashboard themes** — neumorphism, gradient-wave, dark-pro, inman-style, minimal-light, plus brokerage-inspired skins (Keller Williams, RE/MAX, Zillow, eXp, Trulia), Raycast, Brutalist.

**Content engine** — **423** MDX files under \`web/content/stories/\`. Linguist says MDX is ~76% of the repo by bytes. The landing still says “66+ Expert Articles.” The filesystem disagrees in the agent’s favor.

![Stories journal index](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/stories.png)

![Example story — 47-second setup](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/story-47.png)

Public GTM pages: Inman-style editorial landing (orange LIVE strip, green REA**FERRAL** wordmark, navy stats band), Features, Stories, Investors. Auth: Clerk sign-in/up → \`/dashboard\`.

![Clerk sign-up](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/sign-up.png)

![Investors page](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/investors.png)

Positioning in the ProductHunt/HN drafts on disk: core tracking **free forever**; premium later (follow-ups, agreements, payment tracking). I am not pretending the Stripe Connect routes mean the billing story is finished.

![Illustrative pipeline mock — not a live authenticated dashboard](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/pipeline-mock.png)

## Where

It runs on Vercel at **reaferral.vercel.app**. Clerk on the live deploy is still a **dev** instance (\`pk_test_…\`) — the marketing pages render signed-out; the dashboard sits behind auth.

Repo: [HurleyUS/reaferral](https://github.com/HurleyUS/reaferral). Private. Branch \`main\`. HEAD at pack time \`8ba157a\`. **501** commits. Zero GitHub Releases. MIT license file present (copyright line dated 2021).

![Monorepo map](/blog/reaferral-agent-referral-platform/screenshots/repo-structure.png)

The audience sits next to agent networks, Inman-shaped media, and the same Convex/Clerk/Vercel family I use elsewhere — not next to “what is a referral fee” explainers.

Chrome extension lives in a **sibling** repo (\`michaelmonetized/reaferral-chrome-extension\`). Not this pack.

## When

**2024-08-07.** \`init\`.

**2026-01-08.** Docs snap into focus: OPPORTUNITIES, PLAN, README — this is a real-estate referral platform, not a vague hustle.

**2026-02-04.** The real ship week. \`feat: complete Convex backend and core web app\`. GitHub repo created. Landing design variants. Vercel monorepo wiring. Clerk → Convex user sync.

**2026-02-05–06.** Theme system expands. Features + Stories infrastructure. Investors, privacy, terms. Shared chrome. Mobile-friendly dashboard.

**Late February through April.** The content firehose. Hundreds of \`content: add new story\` commits. 413 of them by pack count. Journal becomes the bulk of the tree.

**2026-02-27 onward.** Security passes — auth checks on mutations, collect bounds, Svix verification on Clerk webhooks, console cleanup for production.

**2026-05–06.** CI thrash (Blacksmith) then removal; promo banner overlap fix; nightly commits.

**2026-08-08, morning Eastern.** X-Robots-Tag set to \`index, follow\`, then three unblock fixes so production deploy stops choking. Last push. That is the clock stop for this pack.

**2026-09-08.** Pack day. Site up. \`og-image.png\` 404s. Draft only — no blog publish, no social blast, no git push from this task.

## Why

Because referral income is real and the tooling agents use for it is mostly improvisation.

Because I already had the Convex/Clerk/Next pattern and the missing piece was the vertical: links, fees, stages, teams, and a journal that attracts the people who feel the spreadsheet tax.

Because shipping 423 MDX stories into a private monorepo is a weird flex and also a concrete SEO loop — even when the hero still says 66+.

Because the badge of honesty here is the timeline: February MVP, spring content factory, August robots unblock — still private, still free-forever core, still no tagged release.

What dashboard or sheet are you still using to remember who owes whom on a referral?`;

const BESTJEEP_COVER =
  "/blog/best-jeep-decals-convex-stripe-storefront/cover.png";

const BESTJEEP_CONTENT = `![Best Jeep Decals — Upgrade Your Off-Road Identity](/blog/best-jeep-decals-convex-stripe-storefront/screenshots/landing.png)

## Who

I kept seeing Jeep owners treat identity like an afterthought — a random sticker from a gas-station rack, peeling after one summer on a Wrangler hood.

The people I built for already know their JL from their JK, their Gladiator JT from an XJ Cherokee. They want hood blackouts, “rated” fender badges, side graphics that look like they belong on the trail, not clip art. They want USA vinyl that lasts 5–7 years outdoors, air-release installs, and a checkout that does not feel like 2014 Magento.

If you ship MarTech, Convex + Clerk + Stripe stacks, or local-commerce sites that have to take real money, you are in the room. This is a private HurleyUS storefront — Best Jeep Decals — not a theme demo.

## What

I shipped a dark-first e-commerce site at [bestjeepdecals.com](https://www.bestjeepdecals.com). Orange accent. Italic wordmark. Hero that says the quiet part: **Upgrade Your Off-Road Identity.** Made in the USA badge. Shop All Decals / Browse Wrangler.

![Shop filters — vehicle fitment and price range](/blog/best-jeep-decals-convex-stripe-storefront/screenshots/shop.png)

Stack facts, not pitch deck: **Next.js 16.2.6** (Turbopack) on Vercel, **React 19**, **Convex** for products/categories/carts/orders/reviews/wishlists/discounts/subscriptions, **Clerk** for auth, **Stripe** for checkout, webhooks, portal, and promo codes, **Resend** from \`orders@bestjeepdecals.com\`, **Sentry** + **PostHog** (+ GA). Tailwind 4, Phosphor icons, Zustand cart with persist + promo, Zod + React Hook Form on checkout/admin/newsletter. Package **0.1.0**. Private repo.

Seeded catalog: **30** SKUs at **$29.99** across Hood Decals, Fender Decals, Side Graphics — Compass/Tread/Explorer/Star hood blackouts, Beach/Trail/Squatch/Rescue rated badges, Renegade mountain set, Zombie Outbreak Response Team badge, Since 1941 left/right, and the rest under \`public/products/png\`. Shop filters cover category, $0–$200 price range, and fitment checkboxes for Wrangler JL/JK/TJ, Gladiator JT, Cherokee XJ, Grand Cherokee, Renegade, Compass.

![Empty cart — trust path still on-brand](/blog/best-jeep-decals-convex-stripe-storefront/screenshots/cart.png)

Admin lives under \`(private)/admin\` with \`requireAdmin\` — product CRUD (soft delete), orders, CSV export. Wishlist hearts persist in Convex. Reviews attach to products. Related products on PDPs. Billing defs include a **Decal of the Month Club** at **$14.99/mo** plus gift-card and rush-production add-ons. ROADMAP marks the Zod/RHF, Stripe+Resend, and Zustand modernization pass complete.

![Catalog collage from seeded PNGs](/blog/best-jeep-decals-convex-stripe-storefront/screenshots/catalog-grid.png)

## Where

The storefront lives on the open web: [www.bestjeepdecals.com](https://www.bestjeepdecals.com) (apex redirects to www). GitHub homepage still lists the Vercel alias \`bestjeepdecalscom.vercel.app\`. Code: private [HurleyUS/bestjeepdecals.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/bestjeepdecals.com).

Public routes: shop, product, category, cart, checkout, wishlist. Auth under Clerk catch-alls. Robots.txt allows shop/product/category and blocks admin/api/sign-in/sign-up. Aug 8 added \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` on Vercel so the deploy stops whispering “please ignore me.”

Audience sits next to Jeep forums, jamborees, and every Instagram wrap account that still cannot take a Stripe payment without a third-party form.

## When

**2024-12-16.** Create Next App. Next day: shadcn init. Dec 27: a “ghostty released” commit. Three commits. Then silence through 2025.

**2026-01-08.** The product actually starts. OPPORTUNITIES.md. Homepage pass. Migrate to convex-nextfaster. **Build MVP e-commerce storefront.** Seed script and \`.env.example\` for production readiness.

**2026-02.** Superadmin email gate — then security move to a server component. Stripe webhook signature verification. Admin auth on product mutations. Cart wired with localStorage session and honest success toasts. Checkout rate limiting. Error and loading boundaries. Next.js thrash: bump to 16.1.6 for a CVE, temporary downgrade to 15.5.12 for middleware, Tailwind v3→v4, dark-first production audit.

**2026-03-09–17.** Next 15→16 for real. Delete deprecated \`middleware.ts\`. Restore Clerk on \`proxy.ts\`. Trust signals on cart. Sentry 10 for Next 16. Revenue unlock doc. Google Analytics. robots + next-sitemap. Stripe webhook + order payment flow. Admin dashboard for products and orders. Soft delete. Edit product. CSV export. Promo codes. Shop filters with category, price, Jeep model (#26). Reviews. Wishlists. Related products. Missing catalog images filled in.

**2026-05-14–15.** Blacksmith CI gates on repeat until they stick. Convex URL and Clerk key fallbacks so CI builds do not cry. Deploy health check targets fixed.

**2026-05-22–26.** Redesign commits. Package update PR #28. Sentry instrumentation. dx-maxxing PR #29. Broken images chased. UX passes. **Real catalog seeded** (\`24758dd\`).

**2026-08-08.** Four commits to finish the clock: force \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`, unblock that deploy in \`next.config.ts\`, pin Stripe to package default API version for build compatibility. HEAD \`fd105bd\`. **Ninety-nine commits** from empty Next scaffold to an indexable commerce deploy.

On 2026-09-08 the live \`/\` sometimes hit the error boundary during capture while \`/shop\` and \`/cart\` still painted the dark chrome — Convex/runtime weather, not a rewrite of the journey.

## Why

A Jeep without identity graphics is fine. A checkout that cannot take money, moderate reviews, or keep a wishlist is not a store — it is a mood board.

I wanted the full path: seeded catalog, model fitment filters, Zustand cart with promos, Stripe webhooks that create orders, Resend that tells you it shipped, admin that can soft-delete a SKU and export CSV, CI that builds without secret theater, and a robots header that admits the site wants to be found.

So I kept shipping until the redesign matched the trail aesthetic and the seed matched the PNG drawer. It is still 0.1.0. Decal Club and gift-card add-ons sit in billing defs waiting for the live Stripe dial. That is fine. The document model already holds products, carts, orders, reviews, wishlists, and subscriptions in one Convex project.

If your current Jeep sticker supplier cannot show Wrangler vs Gladiator fitment without a phone call, you already know the hole I was staring at.

What would you put on a Wrangler hood first — a compass blackout, a tread pattern, or a beach-rated badge that starts arguments at the trailhead?

const SONNY_COVER =
  "/blog/sonnys-shining-rubber-hose-beat-em-up/cover.png";

const SONNY_CONTENT = `![The Shining Gazette landing composite](/blog/sonnys-shining-rubber-hose-beat-em-up/screenshots/landing.png)

## Who

I kept catching myself wanting a beat-em-up that felt like Max Fleischer had a bad New Year's Eve and a bowling league problem.

Not another Unity template with a purple capsule for a hero. Not a pitch deck that says "Cuphead vibes" and then ships nothing you can read. I wanted the cast, the fatalities, the alley transitions, and the joke about Lucy's heart following the leaderboard — on disk — before I pretended an engine folder meant progress.

Sonny's Shining is for people who will sit with a Game Design Document. Indie animation nerds. Silent-film weirdos. Operators who think a Stripe Checkout and a refund policy are part of pre-production, not a later surprise. If you build MarTech by day and still care whether Bertie the bartender gets stuffed in a trash can, you are in the room.

## What

I wrote the IP as a stack of plain Markdown and a marketing site that looks like a 1935 newspaper.

The story: New Year's Eve. Bertie's Bustling Bubbles. Sonny — lanky hound dog man, Sonny Tufts energy, ball-shining towel in the back pocket — holds Lucy, a red fox with Lucille Ball danger in the smile. The bartender whispers. She leaves. Kewpie's bowling-pin limo peels out. Eight levels of Kewpie's payroll stand between a tournament bowler and a girl whose heart tracks the standings.

![Eight bosses / levels](/blog/sonnys-shining-rubber-hose-beat-em-up/screenshots/bosses.png)

Combat is bowling-native. Towel catch-and-return. Barehand bottle returns when the timing is honest. Later, a modified ball-return device becomes an over-the-shoulder launcher. Bosses are silent-film and vaudeville ghosts wearing animal suits: Bert Williams behind the bar, Chaplin as a mouse puppeteering a Fabio crab, Desi on the fire escape, Tippi in the dance school, Bessie on the decks, Snub Pollard in the hangar, Ivy Lee on the docks, Kewpie Morgan as the pig kingpin with a shipboard alley that sways on purpose.

Art bible is rubber hose / Fleischer / Roger Rabbit — noodle limbs, pie-cut eyes, four-finger gloves, springy idle. GDD.md is ~1,250 lines. NOVEL.md ~1,600. SCRIPT.md ~800. PLAY.md stages it as a tragedy in three acts. PLAN.md still says engine TBD (Unity or Godot). That sentence is accurate. There is no \`.unity\` or Godot project in this repo yet.

The web half is real software. Next.js 16.2.6, React 19, Tailwind 4, Bun lockfile, package **0.1.0**. Landing is "The Shining Gazette" — ticker tape, masthead, drop caps, classified boxes. \`PreorderButton\` collects email, hits \`POST /api/checkout\`, opens Stripe Checkout for **$8.00** (\`unit_amount: 800\`) with metadata \`sonnys-shining-preorder\` and expected release **Christmas 2026**. Privacy, terms, refunds, and success routes shipped with that checkout.

![Preorder / Stripe surface](/blog/sonnys-shining-rubber-hose-beat-em-up/screenshots/preorder.png)

## Where

Marketing lives at [sonnysshining.com](https://sonnysshining.com). Code at [github.com/michaelmonetized/Sonny-s-Shining](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/Sonny-s-Shining). Public. Empty GitHub description. Empty topics. Zero stars. That is fine — the README and the Gazette carry the pitch.

The audience sits next to every thread that wants Cuphead's lineage without Cuphead's budget, and next to every builder who knows a preorder page without a refund policy is a future apology.

## When

**2025-12-27.** Four commits in one afternoon. \`init\`. Web submodule and last names stripped from the celebrity inspo list. Novel pass. "initalize marketing website for the novel" — yes, that typo is in the commit message. Next 16.1.1 scaffold era.

**2026-01-31.** \`chore: sync all changes\` — one big dump, +1,640 / −79. Writing and early web catching up with each other.

**2026-03-17.** The money day. Privacy, terms, refunds, success. Stripe checkout route. PreorderButton. Newspaper redesign of \`page.tsx\`. PLAN.md lands. ROADMAP.md also lands — and it is wrong. It talks about a cleaning/detailing client site. I am not going to launder that into a feature. It is a stale stub sitting in the tree.

**2026-06-22.** Two \`nightly\` commits. GDD, Stripe cursor rules, fallow review hooks, dependency bump to Next 16.2.6 and \`stripe\` ^22. HEAD \`d6ae3ac\`. Still no engine.

**2026-08-16.** GitHub \`pushed_at\` moves. Main still ends at the June nightly. Eight commits on the ledger. Pack day is September 8, 2026.

That is the journey from empty repo to a design-complete tragedy with a live preorder path and an honest hole where the engine should be.

## Why

I did not want to lie to myself with a blank game project named after a feeling.

So I wrote the characters until Sonny's ears twitched in idle. I wrote the levels until the alley between Bertie and Charlie was a cut, not a load screen pitch. I put $8 and Christmas 2026 on a Stripe session so the promise had a price and a date. I left Unity/Godot as a checkbox in PLAN.md because checking a box is not the same as shipping a towel mechanic.

It is still web 0.1.0. The newsletter form on the lander is a client-side smile, not a list backend. ROADMAP.md needs to be deleted or rewritten. The game does not run. The bible does.

If your current "game idea" folder has a repo and no GDD, or a GDD and no way for someone to give you eight dollars, you already know which hole I was staring at.

Would you lock the Christmas 2026 preorder first — or open the engine folder and refuse to write another fatality until Bertie's bottle timing feels true?

const HMS_CONTENT = `![HMS public home mock — ship the site, edit the site](/blog/hms-hustle-management-system-live-editor/screenshots/public-home.png)

## Who

I kept paying the WordPress tax.

Not the hosting bill. The other tax: Elementor for layout, Dynamic.ooo when Elementor ran out of road, WooCommerce when something had to sell, a pile of PHP templates that only one agency intern understood, and a publish button that still felt like deploying a missile.

HMS is for operators who already know that stack and are done leasing their content model from it. Marketing teams that need a revision trail and a split-test variant without forking a theme. Builders who are happier in Convex + Clerk + Vite+ than in another page-builder SaaS seat.

If you have ever opened a live URL, winced, and opened a totally different admin URL to fix one sentence — you are in the room.

## What

I shipped **HMS — Hustle Management System**. The public site is the product. Pages, posts, products, forms, and templates are **block trees** stored as JSON. Signed-in, you append \`?edit=1\` and edit in place. Visitors keep the same URL. That is the whole thesis.

Stack facts from the lockfile, not the README brochure: **Vite+** (\`vp\` for dev/build/lint/test), **React 19**, **react-router-dom 7**, **Tailwind 4**, shadcn + Base UI, **Zod 4** schemas driving **Convex** tables through \`zodToConvexFields\`, **Clerk** for auth, **Resend** as a Convex email action. Package version **0.0.0**. Public repo under michaelmonetized. Six commits. HEAD \`6f8fa73\`.

![Live editor three-panel mock](/blog/hms-hustle-management-system-live-editor/screenshots/live-editor.png)

The catalog is blunt: Basics, Media, Layout, Proof, Dynamic. Hero, CTA, features, columns, stats, testimonials, FAQ, pricing, logos, collections, menu, search, add-to-cart, cart, forms, document-body. Collections pull pages, posts, products, or media into grid, table, carousel, gallery, or list — and can paint each row with a **loop item** blueprint.

**Blueprints** are one kinded table (ADR 0001): component, form, loop-item, template. Templates carry \`appliesTo\` — header, footer, 404, search, blog archive/single, shop archive, product single. Tokens like \`{{site.name}}\`, \`{{doc.title}}\`, \`{{cart.count}}\` resolve with modifiers. Visibility groups AND/OR on field, schedule, role, referrer, cookie. Revisions snapshot on content update. Variants sit ready for split tests.

Data layer: local store with seed data for offline/dev; Convex when Clerk + Convex env are real (\`isLive\`). Cart lines live in localStorage. Commerce key fields exist on site settings and products — treat full checkout as schema-ready, not a finished money path in this window.

![Manage pages workspace mock](/blog/hms-hustle-management-system-live-editor/screenshots/manage-pages.png)

## Where

Code lives at [github.com/michaelmonetized/hms](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hms). No homepage URL is set on the GitHub repo — this pack does not invent a marketing domain. Local path is \`vp install\` then \`vp dev\`. Manage workspace under \`/manage/*\`. Public surfaces: \`/\`, \`/blog\`, \`/shop\`, \`/search\`, plus typed entries and slugs.

Audience sits next to every thread still arguing Elementor vs Webflow while the real cost is “two URLs for one sentence.” Sibling mail default in the Resend action points at the \`uncap.us\` from-address — same operator family.

![Shop archive mock](/blog/hms-hustle-management-system-live-editor/screenshots/shop.png)

## When

**2026-08-12, 11:17 ET.** \`a62d31d\` initialize. Vite+ scaffold, Max fonts, a full shadcn dump, hero PNG. Two hours later \`07e6672\` configured.

**2026-08-13, 09:40 ET.** \`d95789a\` needs work. Convex pages, posts, products, media, sites, users. First page-builder. Manage shell routes. The CMS bones.

**That evening, 20:57 ET.** \`2404b20\` Ship public site, live editor, revisions, and manage workspace. The thesis lands: the site is the editor.

**2026-08-14, 10:34 ET.** \`12835c6\` new page builder. Catalog depth, finder, blueprints, collections, cart, theme templates. Four minutes later \`6f8fa73\` documents theme templates, search, cart, and library in the changelog. HEAD. Six commits total. Two per day for three days.

![Blueprint library mock](/blog/hms-hustle-management-system-live-editor/screenshots/library-blueprints.png)

## Why

I did not want another theme marketplace. I wanted the visitor URL to be the edit surface, with block JSON on Convex, revisions you can restore, and variants you can assign — without opening a separate Elementor canvas that lies about the front end.

So I compressed the escape into six commits: scaffold, configure, Convex bones, ship public+editor, deepen the builder, write the changelog. Version 0.0.0 on purpose. The README still talks like tanstack-start and zustand are in the room; the lockfile says Vite+ and react-router-dom. I would rather say that out loud than ship a brochure.

If your publish flow still requires a different hostname than your customers use, you already know the hole I was staring at.

What would you put on the first HMS page — the home hero, the shop archive, or the form that finally emails without a PHP plugin?

const TWELVEUX_CONTENT = `![twelveux Glass playground — circle and NEW MATERIAL card](/blog/twelveux-hosted-shadcn-registry-glass/screenshots/playground.png)

## Who

I still install UI the shadcn way. Copy the files. Own the code. The default face is still Inter. The default kit is still New York.

That is fine for a starter. It is not the system I already run on uncap.us and hms — Max type, phi type scale, Catppuccin surfaces.

twelveux is for the operator who wants that system as a registry namespace, not a Figma moodboard. Frontend builders who already type npx shadcn add. People who remember twelve.ux from the WHATWG-era chrome. Anyone who wants liquid glass that is the actual shader, not a blur filter wearing a trench coat.

## What

I built a hosted shadcn/ui registry. Next.js 15. React 19. Tailwind 4. Package version 0.1.0.

Three installable items ship in public/r today: **max**, **theme**, **glass**.

**Max** is the typeface — local woff faces, weights 100 through 900, roman and italic.

**theme** is phi type and spacing, Catppuccin light and dark CSS variables, Max as sans. Same grammar as uncap.us and hms.

**Glass** is the first real component. Official pen.dev glass.glsl. Wrapper. Circle defaults baked in. GlassText is a second path with softer defaults for type.

The playground is the product surface. Live circle. Live card. CIRCLE PROPS sliders. Same wrapper on a shadcn button and a navbar over a photo.

![2012 twelve.ux chrome mock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/twelveux/main/public/og/mock-full.jpg)

/og is the archive. Exact 2009-2012 twelve.ux chrome. /kit is the same chrome under glass.

![glass kit](/blog/twelveux-hosted-shadcn-registry-glass/screenshots/kit-page.png)

## Where

Live on Vercel: https://twelveux.vercel.app — playground, /og, /kit, and /r JSON.

Repo: https://github.com/michaelmonetized/twelveux

registry.json still says homepage https://twelveux.com. That name has no public DNS as of this writing. The host that answers is the Vercel app.

![scene backdrop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/twelveux/main/public/scene.jpg)

## When

**2009-2012.** twelve.ux chrome. The mock on /og still wears that date.

**2026-08-15, 4:42 PM ET.** Initial commit — registry, Glass playground, Max fonts, og/kit mocks, built public/r.

**4:44.** Vercel install freeze fix. **4:46.** Production typecheck fix for Glass. **4:58.** Phone playground. **5:15.** Accordion panes + price ribbon. HEAD 8b9773b.

Five Production deploys the same evening. Five commits. One afternoon.

## Why

I already had a visual system. Max. Phi. Catppuccin. It lived on uncap.us and hms as CSS and fonts, not as something you could npx into a fresh app.

I wanted Glass as a file you install, with the real shader and the circle props, not a screenshot of someone else glassmorphism.

I also still have the 2012 chrome in my head. studioTWELVE. twelve.ux. Putting /og and /kit next to the 2026 playground keeps the arc honest — same operator, longer timeline.

So the registry is the portable form. The playground is the proof. The archive is the scar that stayed.

const GETFARMIN_COVER =

const GETFARMIN_CONTENT = `![GetFarmin home mock — Find. Buy. Farm.](/blog/getfarmin-farm-equipment-marketplace-scaffold/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I got tired of watching six-figure iron move on hope and a Facebook comment thread.

Farm equipment is not a $49 SaaS seat. A 2022 John Deere 8R 370 placeholder in this repo lists at **$385,000**. A Case IH 9250 combine sits at **$425,000**. That is not "add to cart and pray." That is escrow, hours, condition enums, oversize permits, and a seller who might be a dealer with a storefront slug.

GetFarmin is for operators who want that marketplace shape on a real stack — Next, Convex, Clerk, Stripe Connect — before they pretend they have 10,000 live listings. Ag buyers and dealers who are done leasing trust from a local classifieds culture. Builders who would rather ship fee constants in a Convex mutation than wait for the perfect deploy key.

If you have ever tried to move a center pivot across state lines with a spreadsheet and a handshake, you are in the room.

## What

I built **GetFarmin** — package name \`getfarmin\`, version **0.1.0**, private under **HurleyUS/getfarmin.com**. Metadata line: *Global Farm Equipment Marketplace*. Hero line: **Find. Buy. Farm.**

Stack facts from the lockfile and tree, not the stale sitrep: **Next.js 16.2.6**, **React 19.2.6**, **Tailwind 4.3**, Bun, **Convex** schema + queries/mutations, **Clerk** auth surfaces, **Stripe** webhook route + Connect escrow scaffolding, Catppuccin Mocha default with green primary, Resend/Sentry/PostHog wired in \`.env.example\`. Thirty-six commits. HEAD \`4b5df30\`.

![Browse mock with placeholder iron](/blog/getfarmin-farm-equipment-marketplace-scaffold/screenshots/browse.png)

Surfaces that exist in \`app/\`: \`/\` marketing, \`/browse\` with URL \`searchParams\` filters and placeholder cards from \`lib/placeholder-data.ts\`, \`/about\`, \`/dashboard\`, \`/listing/new\` multi-step form, \`/dealers/[slug]\`, Clerk sign-in/up catch-alls, \`POST /api/shipping/estimate\`, Stripe webhook route.

Convex tables: \`listings\`, \`categories\`, \`users\`, \`dealerProfiles\`, \`messages\`, \`savedListings\`, \`payments\`. Listing tiers: basic / enhanced / dealer. Conditions: new through salvage. Escrow math in \`convex/payments.ts\`: platform **2.9% + $0.30**, escrow **1.5%**, optional buyer protection **+2%**. Comments say PaymentIntent creation is deferred — schema-ready money path, not a finished Connect onboarding wizard.

Shipping estimator in \`lib/shipping-estimate.ts\`: base **$250**, **$2.10**/mile, **$38**/1000 lb, oversize and expedite flags, honest notes about permits and long-haul variance.

![Dashboard mock — inbox + escrow](/blog/getfarmin-farm-equipment-marketplace-scaffold/screenshots/dashboard.png)

## Where

Code lives at [github.com/HurleyUS/getfarmin.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/getfarmin.com) — **private**. GitHub homepage points at [getfarmin-com.vercel.app](https://getfarmin-com.vercel.app). At pack time that URL returned **HTTP 500** with \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` (the Aug 8 header fix). This pack does not invent a healthy production story.

Audience sits next to MachineryTrader / TractorHouse energy, with a builder twist: Catppuccin dark-first UI, compound Convex indexes, issue-driven February feature closeout. Sibling operator furniture is present — \`.hustlemc\`, Blacksmith ship workflow, fallow REVIEW, Stripe sanity rule file.

![New listing multi-step mock](/blog/getfarmin-farm-equipment-marketplace-scaffold/screenshots/listing-new.png)

## When

**2026-01-08.** \`8107c34\` Initial commit: Next.js, Convex, Tailwind. Same morning \`f717dcf\` OPPORTUNITIES + homepage. Afternoon \`381035b\` PLAN improvement list. The market thesis lands day one: global farm equipment, used market, listing tiers, escrow, shipping.

**2026-01-31 / 2026-02-05.** Sync. Prod build ready.

**2026-02-06.** \`6f764f9\` upgrade to Next.js 16, React 19. Tailwind v4 globals \`@import\` fix follows.

**2026-02-13.** \`0afe002\` dark mode, Catppuccin theme system, browse/about pages, Convex schema.

**2026-02-21–22.** Standards debt burned down — error/loading/not-found, env validation, Zod validations, providers, schema foreign keys as \`v.id("users")\`, merged fix PRs.

**2026-02-23–24.** The marketplace week. Search and filtering. Clerk buyer/seller dashboard. Listing creation flow. In-app messaging. Stripe Connect + escrow scaffolding. Dealer storefronts + tiers. Convex bootstrap scripts. Heavy-equipment shipping estimate API. Issues **#1–#8** closed with matching PRs.

**2026-05-14–15.** Eleven commits of Blacksmith CI gates, Biome, preflight, deploy URL verification.

**2026-08-08, 06:54 ET.** \`4b5df30\` set X-Robots-Tag to index, follow on Vercel. HEAD. Thirty-six commits total.

**Pack day 2026-09-08.** Draft and assets only. Live preview still 500s. \`sitrep.md\` still claims purpose unclear and last commit February 5 — treat it as drift, not truth.

![Shipping estimate mock](/blog/getfarmin-farm-equipment-marketplace-scaffold/screenshots/shipping-estimate.png)

## Why

I did not want another "agriculture somehow" landing page with emoji tractors.

I wanted fee constants next to listing status enums. I wanted a shipping function that admits a 22-foot load needs permits. I wanted dealer slugs and message threads on the same Convex deployment shape as the browse grid — even while the browse grid still reads placeholder data and the Vercel deployment throws 500s.

So the February issue board became the product: close search, auth, listing form, chat, escrow, dealers, shipping, bootstrap. May hardened the gates. August flipped robots headers on a site that still needs a living Convex URL.

If your marketplace README promises 10,000 listings and your \`payments\` table cannot say \`in_escrow\`, you already know the hole I was staring at.

Would you price a six-figure tractor listing as free basic inventory, or charge the $49 enhanced tier before the first escrow release clears?

const MERCHWINNER_COVER =
  "/blog/merchwinner-pod-course-marketplace/cover.png";

const MERCHWINNER_CONTENT = `![MerchWinner live home — Start Learning / Become an Instructor](/blog/merchwinner-pod-course-marketplace/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I kept meeting people who wanted Amazon Merch, Etsy POD, and Shopify print-on-demand to pay rent — and who were buying theory courses from people who had not shipped a design in years.

MerchWinner is for aspiring merch sellers who want practitioners. It is for active sellers who will teach if the split and the platform are not a second job. It is for operators who want to see a full Clerk + Convex + Stripe course-marketplace shape on Next.js 16 without pretending the catalog is full.

If you have ever built the checkout before the first SKU, you are in the room.

## What

I shipped **MerchWinner.com** — a user-contributed course marketplace for learning how to sell merch online. Public surfaces: home, \`/courses\` with search/category/sort, course detail + lesson player, \`/instructors\`, \`/about\`. Instructor workspace for create/edit/publish, lesson reorder, earnings, analytics, profile. Student enrollment dashboard. Money path on Stripe: one-time course and bundle checkout, Pro/Unlimited memberships, webhook → Convex purchases/subscriptions, Resend mail for enrollment, invoice, renewal, review reminders.

Stack from the lockfile, not the stale README line: **Next.js ^16.2.6**, **React ^19.2.6**, **Convex ^1.38.0**, **Clerk**, **Stripe ^22.1.1**, **Resend**, PostHog, Sentry, Tailwind v4, Radix, Catppuccin Mocha default. Package **0.1.0**, private under HurleyUS. **86** commits. HEAD \`65c4413\`.

![Live courses page — search UI with empty catalog](/blog/merchwinner-pod-course-marketplace/screenshots/courses-live.png)

Billing facts in \`lib/billing.ts\`: \`PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT = 20\` (creator net 80%). Plans: Pro **$29/mo** / **$278/yr** (3 courses/month) and Unlimited **$49/mo** / **$470/yr**. Homepage marketing still says “Earn 70% of every course sale.” I would rather name the mismatch than paper it over.

Convex schema covers users (student/instructor/admin), instructorProfiles, courses, lessons, enrollments with progress, subscriptions, coursePurchases, bundlePurchases, payoutRequests, reviews. Eighteen App Router pages. Fourteen API routes. Bun + Biome + ship script.

![About page — practitioner POD curriculum](/blog/merchwinner-pod-course-marketplace/screenshots/about.png)

## Where

Code lives at [github.com/HurleyUS/merchwinner.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/merchwinner.com) (private). Live site: [www.merchwinner.com](https://www.merchwinner.com). Vercel project URL on the repo homepage field: [merchwinner-com.vercel.app](https://merchwinner-com.vercel.app). Apex redirects to www.

Audience sits next to every POD Discord still arguing Redbubble vs Merch while nobody ships curriculum. Contact in README: michael@hustlelaunch.com. Same operator family as the other HurleyUS Next/Convex products.

![Instructors page — shell loaded, no profiles yet](/blog/merchwinner-pod-course-marketplace/screenshots/instructors-live.png)

## When

**2026-01-08.** \`91c1e8e\` Initial commit: Next.js, Convex, Tailwind. Same day: opportunities doc and homepage pass.

**February.** Next 16 + React 19. Catppuccin dark mode, layout variants, stub \`/courses\` and \`/about\`. Feb 21 standards mega-fix closes a pile of issues — middleware, providers, schema, icons, fonts, email docs.

**March 20–22.** Stripe checkout patterns, instructor profile and earnings, webhook typing. Money enters the building.

**March 25.** Fourteen commits. Resend templates. Phase 2 webhook→email. Phase 3a–3c: instructor course creation, lesson manage UI, student enrollment and lesson player.

**March 26.** Nineteen commits. Phase 4 search/filters/SEO/schema markup. Phase 5 reviews UI + reminders. Phase 6a/6b earnings and analytics merges. Production-ready checklist docs.

**March 27.** Catppuccin unify across the site. Instructor and enrollment CTAs.

**May 13–15.** shipprep standards and a Blacksmith CI/deploy verification flurry.

**2026-08-08, 06:55 ET.** \`65c4413\` set X-Robots-Tag to index, follow on Vercel. HEAD. Eighty-six commits total.

On September 8, 2026 the live \`/courses\` page still reads **“No courses available yet.”** The marketplace shipped. The catalog did not.

![Illustrative instructor earnings mock — 20% platform fee math](/blog/merchwinner-pod-course-marketplace/screenshots/instructor-earnings-mock.png)

## Why

I did not want another “courses coming soon” landing page with a Mailchimp box. I wanted the boring spine: auth roles, course/lesson tables, Stripe sessions, webhooks that enroll, email that confirms, instructor earnings that know the fee, student progress that is not a Google Sheet.

So I compressed the spine across six phases and left the honesty visible: empty catalog, empty instructors grid, README still claiming Next 15.5.6 and Payments N/A while Stripe and Next 16 are in the lockfile. Version 0.1.0. Private on purpose until the first real courses earn the public launch.

If your marketplace admin is prettier than your course list, you already know the hole I was staring at.

What would you publish first on MerchWinner — Amazon Merch niche research, Etsy POD ops, or TikTok ads that actually sell shirts?

const OMNUX_REPORT_COVER =
  "/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/cover.png";

const OMNUX_REPORT_CONTENT = `<!-- Cover: upload og.png to Convex storage; embed storage URLs below after upload. Local refs for draft review. -->

![OMNUX-REPORT OG — one-command diagnostics with consent + redaction](/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/cover.png)

![Honest state — shipped, validated, unfinished named](/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/screenshots/honest-state.png)

## Who

I am the person who already published the Omnux truth table and the omnux-gpu siege wall. Those posts are live. This one is a different room.

This piece is for owners who will file a bug with receipts and refuse to paste a 400 MB journal that still contains a MAC address. For operators who need backlight, WiFi, DRM, speakersafetyd, and sleep lines before the archaeology starts. For SEP/TouchID researchers who need device-tree names and module hints without biometric material. For agent operators who are supposed to produce owner telemetry under the Omnux mandate without turning consent into theater.

If you need a curl install or a truth table, that is the umbrella post. If you need M3 AGX pixels named as a project with acceptance criteria, that is the GPU post. If you need an attachable evidence bundle the owner controls, that is this room.

## What

I shipped **omnux-report** — a MIT Shell tool whose entire job is to make Apple Silicon Omnux machines comparable in an issue tracker without scooping secrets by default.

One command. Offline. Installed system or live USB. Consent summary prints exactly what will be gathered. Redaction is on unless you opt out. The output is a single \`.tar.zst\` (gzip fallback if zstd is missing) plus a SHA256 sidecar. Attach both.

![Collection pipeline — Consent Collect Cap Triage Redact Archive](/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/screenshots/pipeline.png)

The pipeline is boring on purpose:

1. **Consent** — list journal/sysinfo/SEP structure, optional benches, optional ADT helper; show redaction state; wait for \`y\` unless \`--yes\`.
2. **Collect** — sysinfo, severity-scoped logs, SEP structure, optional benchmarks, optional ADT instructions.
3. **Cap** — any single file over 50 MiB keeps its last 50 MiB with a TRUNCATED header so a pathological journal cannot produce an unattachable blob.
4. **Triage** — \`summary.txt\` with PASS / INFO / WARN / FAIL / SKIP per subsystem.
5. **Redact** — MACs to \`XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\`; key=value secret backstops; count written to \`redaction-count.txt\`.
6. **Archive** — deterministic tar (\`--sort=name\`, fixed mtime) compressed; checksum sidecar.

![Bundle schema v1 — logs sysinfo sep benches adt skipped](/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/screenshots/bundle-schema.png)

The schema is documented in \`docs/SCHEMA.md\`. Logs arrive as current boot, previous boot, error, warning — full history is opt-in because long-lived installs turn “helpful” into hundreds of megabytes. Sysinfo covers identity (model, compatible, chip ids), CPU/memory/kernel, package versions and Omarchy markers, device-tree \`/chosen\` **property names only**, block devices without serials, NVMe model+firmware, displays, Type-C roles, scrubbed network, audio/speaker-safety, GPU DRM/EGL state. Benchmarks default to CPU openssl + portable dd probes; glmark2 and vulkaninfo stay opt-in and always sit next to \`benchmarks/context.txt\` so a number without a model/kernel/mesa line is treated as noise.

![Redaction rules — scrubbed, never collected, kept deliberately](/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/screenshots/redaction-rules.png)

Redaction is the product feature, not the apology. Serial numbers, WiFi/Bluetooth keys, NetworkManager secrets, and \`/etc/machine-id\` are never collected. Interface addresses and SSIDs are scrubbed at collection time so a global regex cannot corrupt timestamps. Secret scrubbing matches only \`key=value\` / \`key:value\` forms — journal prose like “Forward Password Requests to Wall” survives. Filesystem UUIDs stay because boot debugging needs them; hostnames stay because owners can edit a bundle before attaching if they care.

The SEP section exists for the TouchID-on-Apple-Silicon research program tracked on omnux-gpu issues #10 and #13. It captures device-tree node names and \`reg\` bytes, \`/dev\` and \`/sys\` bus matches, module and modprobe hints, and firmware identifiers. It does **not** collect enrollment data, biometric templates, keys, tickets, nonces, TSS responses, or FDR dictionaries. Structure that helps match hardware. Nothing that reproduces security state.

\`--adt\` does not dump an Apple Device Tree on the reporting machine. It writes guided instructions for a second host running m1n1’s proxyclient, pre-filled with this machine’s model, plus a scrub checklist before attach to omnux#4.

![Triage vocabulary — PASS INFO WARN FAIL SKIP](/blog/omnux-report-one-command-diagnostics-redaction/screenshots/triage-vocab.png)

Triage is the first screen a bug reader should see: machine Apple-or-fail, DRM render node presence, backlight class, WiFi interface/soft-block, Omarchy release marker, mem_sleep states, speakersafetyd, SEP-named DT nodes. Honest and boring.

On 2026-08-26 this produced a complete redacted 3.5 MB bundle on a real MacBook Pro 16-inch M1 Pro running Omarchy. The same day, \`test/fixture-test.sh\` ran ten checks against a synthetic Apple Silicon sysroot on ordinary Linux — model identity, compatible string, journal skip in fixture mode, triage PASS, ADT helper text, size cap, MAC scrub, secret scrub, prose survival, SHA256 verify. That is the receipt that the pipeline is not “works on my journal.”

What is not done is also named: packaging into the mx-mac live image, glmark2/vulkaninfo validation on machines that actually have them installed, and an owner-facing release. Working tool. Validated. Not finished product marketing.

## Where

It lives where an Omnux or Omarchy Apple Silicon machine — or the live USB — can run a bash script without a network. Fixture mode lives anywhere Linux so CI cosplay is unnecessary for the collectors themselves.

Repo: [michaelmonetized/omnux-report](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux-report). Normative feature spec still points at [omnux#2](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux/issues/2). ADT collection issue: [omnux#4](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux/issues/4). SEP research adjacency: omnux-gpu #10/#13. Parent ship lane: [omnux](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux). GPU siege: [omnux-gpu](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/omnux-gpu).

Local clone used for this pack: \`/home/michael/Projects/omnux-report\` on m1pro16 @ \`f9729a6\`.

## When

**2026-08-26.** Scaffold commit \`1019bda\` — honest state, omnux#2 pointer, layout, offline/consent/evidence principles. Same day: \`aac9244\` lands v0.1.0 — working collectors, triage, redaction, archive. Same day validation: real M1 Pro Omarchy redacted bundle at 3.5 MB; fixture harness ten checks green.

**2026-08-27.** Commit \`f9729a6\` adds the SEP/TouchID evidence collector wired to the omnux-gpu research issues — structure only, secrets excluded by design. Last push \`2026-08-27T18:34:44Z\`.

**2026-09-08.** Content pack drafted. Live omnux and omnux-gpu posts already cover install truth and the AGX wall. This draft stays unique: diagnostics consent and redaction. Still no mx-mac packaging. Still no owner-facing release ceremony.

## Why

Owner telemetry without owner control is just surveillance with a README. I wanted a command that tells you what it will gather before it gathers it. I wanted redaction as the default path so attaching a bug is not a privacy coin-flip. I wanted numbers that only mean something next to model, kernel, and Mesa lines. I wanted SEP research to have evidence without becoming a biometric vacuum. I wanted a fixture that proves the pipeline on machines that are not Apple silicon so the tool does not only exist in folklore.

The Omnux story splits cleanly across three repos: the umbrella ships the install lane and the truth table; omnux-gpu names the driver wall without claiming pixels; omnux-report turns “please attach logs” into a consenting, redacted, checksummed artifact. That is the ask — run the command, read the triage, attach the two files.

const WNC_TOURS_CONTENT = `![WNC History Tours homepage mock — Discover the Rich History of Western North Carolina](/blog/wnc-history-tours-booking-shell-before-detail-pages/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I live in the Blue Ridge ops lane. Visitors want a walking tour, a ghost walk, a cemetery afternoon, or a Cherokee heritage day without bouncing between five operator websites and a generic Viator card. Guides want a place to list and take a booking without building their own Next app.

WNC History Tours is for people hunting history experiences from Asheville to Cherokee — and for the small companies that run those walks.

If you build MarTech, local directories, or Stripe-backed booking surfaces: this post is the field notes on what shipped and what did not.

## What

I built a tour booking platform shell for Western North Carolina history tours.

Stack on the box: **Next.js 16.2.6**, React 19, **Convex**, **Clerk**, Stripe (dependency + env slots), PostHog, Sentry, Resend, Tailwind v4, Bun, Vitest, Vercel config. Repo is private under \`HurleyUS/wnchistorytours.com\`. Package version **0.1.0**. README still says Next 15.5.6 — the lockfile moved on.

![Convex schema — companies, tours, bookings, reviews](/blog/wnc-history-tours-booking-shell-before-detail-pages/screenshots/schema.png)

What exists in code:

- Amber/stone homepage with search form, city chips, category cards, featured tour grid
- Convex tables for \`companies\`, \`tours\`, \`bookings\`, \`reviews\` with search indexes
- Tour queries (featured, search, by company/slug) and booking create/status mutations
- Seed mutation for three demo companies and five tours
- Clerk middleware in \`proxy.ts\` with public matchers for the routes I planned to build
- SEO (\`sitemap.ts\`, \`robots.ts\`), error boundaries, HTTP security headers, Blacksmith/shipprep CI gates

What does **not** exist as \`app/\` routes despite the nav and cards linking to them: \`/tours\`, \`/companies\`, \`/city/*\`, \`/category/*\`, \`/search\`, \`/tour/[company]/[tour]\`, \`/list-your-business\`, booking checkout. No \`components/\` folder. No Stripe checkout route.

Homepage falls back to hardcoded demo tours when Convex queries are still loading or empty. Category counts (24 walking, 12 ghost, …) are UI constants. The seed script drifts from the schema — \`rating\` vs \`averageRating\`, duration type, missing required company fields — so “production readiness” in that commit message is aspirational.

![Declared stack vs actual app tree](/blog/wnc-history-tours-booking-shell-before-detail-pages/screenshots/stack-gap.png)

## Where

Intended host: [wnchistorytours.com](https://wnchistorytours.com). Layout OG, sitemap, and robots all point there. On pack day the domain returned **Cloudflare 526** (origin TLS/unreachable). \`vercel.json\` also sets \`deploymentEnabled\` for \`main\`/\`master\` to **false** — auto-deploy from those branches is off.

Auth path is Clerk. Money path is declared Stripe in \`.env.example\`. Mail is Resend. Errors go to Sentry. Product events go to PostHog. Maps key slot exists for meeting points later.

Audience sits in Western North Carolina heritage tourism and with builders shipping local vertical directories next to products like BestWNC.

## When

**2026-01-08.** Init. Same day: opportunities doc, homepage pass, Convex tour booking MVP (schema + bookings + tours + provider), PLAN updates, \`.env.example\` + seed. Six January commits. The product idea and the shell landed together.

**January 31.** Chore sync.

**February.** Upgrade to Next.js 16 and React 19. Tailwind v4 CSS-first. Clerk middleware and \`cn()\`. Strict TypeScript. Error boundaries. Sitemap and robots. Security headers. Auth check on \`bookings.updateStatus\`. Query \`.take(100)\` bounds. TypeScript fix PRs.

**March.** Vitest smoke coverage. More TS cleanup. Remove GitHub Actions — Vercel called out as CI. ESLint flat config.

**May.** Densest month (15 commits). shipprep standards, Blacksmith CI gate standardization (many near-duplicate gate commits), local preflight, deploy URL and health-check fixes. Platform reliability work while detail pages stay unbuilt.

**2026-08-08 6:55 AM ET.** \`c298e54\` — set \`X-Robots-Tag\` to \`index, follow\` on Vercel. HEAD. Thirty-seven commits on \`main\`.

That is the clock from empty repo to a hardened shell with an unfinished booking funnel.

![Commit journey Jan through Aug](/blog/wnc-history-tours-booking-shell-before-detail-pages/screenshots/journey.png)

## Why

Directories and booking marketplaces fail two ways: vapor landers with no schema, or beautiful CI with no product routes. I did the honest middle — real Convex models and a real lander — then spent spring on Next 16, Clerk, SEO, and Blacksmith while the tour detail and Stripe checkout pages stayed on PLAN.md.

The domain is named. The robots header asks to be indexed. The origin was 526 when I checked. That gap is part of the story.

Sibling context: BestWNC is the broader WNC business directory. This repo is the narrower history-tour vertical. Same region, different job.

If you run walking tours in Asheville or Cherokee, would you list on a WNC-only history board — or is Viator still the only checkout that matters?

const YOURZAXBYS_COVER =
  "/blog/yourzaxbys-franchise-management-platform/cover.png";

const YOURZAXBYS_CONTENT = `![Your ZAXBYS landing hero on Vercel](/blog/yourzaxbys-franchise-management-platform/screenshots/landing.png)

## Who

I kept catching myself watching franchise operators bounce between a POS export, a Steritech PDF, a schedule spreadsheet, and a text thread that somehow became HR.

Not another generic “restaurant dashboard” template with fake charts and a purple sidebar. Not a pitch that says multi-unit without a stores table. I wanted the above-store view and the store-level pain in the same repo family — with real auth, real email, and an honest hole where the custom domain DNS still is not answering from my network.

Your ZAXBYS is for multi-unit Zaxby's owners, above-store folks, and GMs who will sit with a CAP form. Operators who think Clerk + Convex is a product decision, not a tutorial. If you run MarTech by day and still care whether a food-safety observation has a written plan, you are in the room.

## What

I built a franchise management platform as a Next.js app with a marketing shell and a gated dashboard.

Public surface: hero lander, features, pricing, about, testimonials, blog stub, contact, privacy. Clerk sign-in / sign-up. CTAs now point at \`/signup\` — that wiring was a March 1 fix, not day-one magic. Pricing page sells **Starter $99/mo**, **Professional $199/mo**, **Enterprise Custom**, plus add-ons ($25 per extra location, analytics, integrations setup, priority support). FinalCTA still shows a placeholder \`(555) 123-ZAXBYS\`. I am not going to pretend that is a real phone bank.

![Pricing lander on Vercel](/blog/yourzaxbys-franchise-management-platform/screenshots/pricing.png)

Private surface: \`/dashboard\` with stores, employees, schedule, audits, reports, settings. Convex schema is the spine — \`employees\` (roles from \`franchise_owner\` down to \`team_member\`, \`eid\` like \`ZAX######\`, **\`ssnLast4\` only**), \`stores\`, \`schedules\` + \`shifts\`, \`caps\` (food safety / RER with observation → solution → plan), \`audits\` (Steritech, health department, internal, RER), \`salesData\`, \`feedback\`, \`notifications\`. Resend routes send confirmation, invite, and notification mail from \`notify@yourzaxbys.com\`. Invite copy still names **Zaxby's Waynesville, NC** — the sibling store product is not theoretical.

Stack on disk: Next **16.1.6**, React 19, Convex, Clerk, Radix + Tailwind, Sentry (\`hustle-launch\` / \`shipthing\`), PostHog provider, Bun lockfile, package **\`zaxbys-franchise-management-platform\` \`1.0.0\`**. \`proxy.ts\` is the Next 16 rename of middleware. Blacksmith \`ship.yml\` pulls Vercel env and Convex deploy keys.

![Illustrative dashboard composite from schema + routes](/blog/yourzaxbys-franchise-management-platform/screenshots/dashboard-composite.png)

Honesty checks: the lander brags \`500+\` locations / \`25%\` cost reduction / \`99.9%\` uptime / \`4.9★\`. Those strings live in \`app/page.tsx\`. They are not a warehouse receipt. Unauthenticated \`/dashboard\` on the Vercel alias returned 404 at pack time — no logged-in screenshot. README still tells you to clone \`michaelmonetized/www.yourzaxbys.com\`; the GitHub org is **HurleyUS**. AUTOPSY.md from February roasted a missing navbar and missing SEO files; HEAD has \`manifest.ts\`, \`sitemap.ts\`, \`robots.ts\`. Treat the autopsy as a scar, not the current build report.

## Where

Code: [github.com/HurleyUS/www.yourzaxbys.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/www.yourzaxbys.com). Public. Empty description. Empty topics. Zero stars.

Live alias that answered HTTP 200 for this pack: [wwwyourzaxbyscom.vercel.app](https://wwwyourzaxbyscom.vercel.app). GitHub homepage field points there. Custom domain \`www.yourzaxbys.com\` did **not** resolve from the pack hosts — NXDOMAIN. Sibling store app: private [waynesville.yourzaxbys.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/waynesville.yourzaxbys.com) with its own Vercel alias.

The audience sits next to every franchise thread that wants one login for labor, audits, and CAP follow-ups, and next to every builder who knows a SaaS pricing page without a protect() boundary is cosplay.

## When

**2025-03-07 → 03-09.** First \`init\` commits under Michael Monetized. Fonts. Style passes. The classic “we gotta push to main to see minor changes yuck” loop. Repo created on GitHub 2025-03-08.

**2025-10-02.** Another \`init\` — reboot marker on the timeline.

**2025-10-15.** The YOLO pivot. Commit message literally: letting CodeRabbit and GPT5 duke out a refactor into a new project idea. Missing deps. Bun trusts. “Updated everything YOLO.” “says ready for prod :shrug:” Accessibility vibing. That afternoon is when the franchise platform stopped being a mood and became a tree.

**2025-10-16.** Marketing pages land.

**2025-12-29.** CVE dependency passes.

**2026-01-08.** PLAN.md — multi-store dashboard, unified reporting, document library, the above-store wishlist.

**2026-01-31.** Big \`chore: sync all changes\`.

**2026-02-04.** \`Add complete franchise management dashboard\` — the product-shaped commit.

**2026-02-06 → 02-21.** Next 16 \`proxy.ts\` rename. Security: SSN off the wire, \`ssnLast4\` in schema, encrypt-at-rest notes in changelog, email domain / EID standardization (#11, #12).

**2026-02-28 → 03-09.** TypeScript fix PR. Strip thirteen console statements. Wire CTAs to \`/signup\`. Bump Next to **16.1.6** for CVEs (#21).

**2026-05-14.** Blacksmith CI gates standardized across a stack of commits. Lazy-init Resend clients. Skip Convex provider when public env is missing so the marketing shell does not die without a deployment.

**2026-08-08.** \`fix: set X-Robots-Tag to index, follow on Vercel\`. HEAD \`705473f\`. Forty-six commits on the ledger. Pack day is September 8, 2026.

That is the journey from font fiddling to a versioned franchise ops platform with a live Vercel alias and a custom domain that still needs DNS honesty.

## Why

I did not want the store and the above-store to keep living in different tabs forever.

So I put employees, stores, schedules, CAPs, and audits in one Convex schema. I put Clerk in front of the dashboard and Resend on the invite path. I left the marketing stats labeled as marketing. I left the Waynesville invite copy as a breadcrumb to the sibling store app. I set package **1.0.0** knowing “1.0” here means the platform shape shipped — not that every PLAN.md checkbox is green.

sitrep still says WIP and HIGH client priority. ROADMAP still wants owner UAT. That is fine. The repo is not empty, not a junk stub, and not a logo dump. It is a franchise ops bet with receipts in git.

If your current “franchise tool” folder has a pricing page and no \`ssnLast4\` decision, or a dashboard route and no protect middleware, you already know which hole I was staring at.

Would you fix \`www.yourzaxbys.com\` DNS and run a real owner pilot next — or delete the fake 500+ lander stats before anyone quotes them as proof?

const MOCKUP_GALLERY_CONTENT = `![Web Design Portfolio chrome with Prestige luxury real estate tab](/blog/mockup-gallery-ten-industry-cold-outreach/screenshots/gallery-home.png)

## Who

I sell web design the old way sometimes. Email. Industry angle. Proof.

Prospects do not want a Figma file. They want to see what *their* kind of site could look like — real estate, HVAC, SaaS, a restaurant booker — without waiting on a custom sprint.

mockup-gallery is for that motion. Local operators. SMB owners. Anyone I can send a link and a short note. Frontend people who care how a sales kit is actually built under Next 16 and Tailwind 4. Not the twelveux registry crowd. Not a single vertical client delivery.

## What

I built a public Next.js gallery. Package name \`design-mockups\`. Version **1.0.0**. React 19. Tailwind 4. Bun lockfile. Lucide icons.

One client page. Sticky dark portfolio chrome. Ten tabs. Each tab mounts a full-page industry lander under \`app/components/mockups/\`.

The brands on the tabs: **Prestige**, **Velocity Motors**, **Nexus Consulting**, **ARIA**, **ZENITH**, **HandyPro**, **Analytics Pro**, **LearnHub**, **TableHub**, **VoyageNow**.

Roughly twenty-six hundred lines of mockup TSX. No per-mockup routes — tab state only. README ships a cold-outreach template (sign-off in-file still says “—Rusty”).

Observability landed later: Sentry, PostHog, Fallow, Blacksmith \`ship.yml\`.

![HandyPro home services mockup](/blog/mockup-gallery-ten-industry-cold-outreach/screenshots/home-services.png)

## When

**2026-03-28, 7:21 PM ET.** Ten mockups land. Same evening Tailwind v4 / PostCSS / Vercel CSS fight through \`61dda20\`.

**2026-05-14 afternoon.** Blacksmith CI standardization + Fallow/FReview scaffolding + formatter green.

**2026-08-08, 6:55 AM ET.** HEAD \`21f44ec\` — robots \`index, follow\`. Twenty commits. Package 1.0.0.

## Why

I needed a link for industry email without a bespoke repo per vertical. Ten tabbed landers is that link.

Tailwind v4 pain is part of the truth. May CI/observability is the operator habit. August robots flip says the page is meant to be found.

What industry tab would you send first?
`;

const S12IN_COVER =
  "/blog/s12-in-url-shortener-file-hosting/cover.png";

const S12IN_CONTENT = `![s12.in landing — Short links, powerful results](/blog/s12-in-url-shortener-file-hosting/screenshots/landing.png)

## Who

I got tired of leasing short links from tools that treat a redirect like a subscription upsell.

Operators — marketers, founders, agencies, anyone pasting campaign URLs into SMS and decks — need a domain they own, a dashboard that lists what they created, and click facts that survive the redirect. Developers already on Convex and Clerk do not need a fifth SaaS login for “paste URL, get code.”

s12.in is for that seat. If you live in MarTech, ship Next.js on Vercel, or just want \`s12.in/abc\` instead of a twenty-character tracking URL, you are in the room.

## What

I shipped a URL shortener and file host at [s12.in](https://s12.in).

Stack facts, not pitch deck: **Next.js 16.1.6** (App Router, Turbopack) on Vercel, **React 19.2**, **Convex** for links/files/clicks/users plus \`_storage\` uploads, **Clerk** for auth, **Tailwind CSS v4**, Radix primitives, Resend in the lockfile, Biome + oxlint + tsgo. Package name \`s12\`, version **0.1.0**, packageManager **bun@1.3.1**. Repo is **private** under HurleyUS.

![Dashboard — shorten, upload, manage](/blog/s12-in-url-shortener-file-hosting/screenshots/dashboard.png)

Paste a long URL on the homepage or dashboard. Convex \`links.create\` issues a short code (optional \`customCode\` / \`password\` / \`expiresAt\` exist on the schema; the public form only sends \`url\` + optional \`userId\`). \`app/[code]/route.ts\` resolves the code, parses user-agent, reads Vercel geo headers, hashes the IP with SHA-256 + a salt (16 hex chars), fires \`recordClick\` without blocking, then **302**s. Files take the same path: viewable MIME types redirect to the Convex storage URL; others return an attachment stream.

Dashboard tabs list your links and files with copy/delete. Click and download counters are denormalized on the row. \`getAnalytics\` can roll up by day/country/browser/device/referrer — charts are not on the dashboard yet.

A Manifest V3 Chrome extension scaffold lives under \`extension/\` and posts to \`/api/shorten\` with CORS. Icon PNGs are still marked \`ICONS_NEEDED.md\` (SVG only in tree).

Honesty, because operators smell it: the hero still prints **10M+ / 50K+ / 99.9%** as static JSX. The live Clerk publishable key I hit was **pk_test** on \`*.clerk.accounts.dev\`. README still names PostHog and Sentry; those packages were removed Feb 21. Footer GitHub still points at \`michaelmonetized/s12.in\` while the working private remote is **HurleyUS/s12.in**. Schema \`users.plan\` free|pro|team is ahead of any billing UI.

![Redirect pipeline](/blog/s12-in-url-shortener-file-hosting/screenshots/redirect-pipeline.png)

## Where

Product: [s12.in](https://s12.in) (apex redirects toward www). Vercel project alias on the GitHub homepage field: [s12-in.vercel.app](https://s12-in.vercel.app). Routes that matter: \`/\`, \`/dashboard\`, \`/sign-in\`, \`/sign-up\`, \`/privacy\`, \`/terms\`, \`/refunds\`, \`/api/shorten\`, \`/[code]\`.

Code: [github.com/HurleyUS/s12.in](https://github.com/HurleyUS/s12.in) — private, no topics, no license file, no tagged releases. Deploy path is Vercel continuous with a Blacksmith \`ship.yml\` gate. Local path: \`bun install\`, \`bunx convex dev\`, \`bun dev\`.

Audience sits next to every “just use Bitly” thread and every Convex starter that never grew a redirect route.

![Chrome extension scaffold](/blog/s12-in-url-shortener-file-hosting/screenshots/extension.png)

## When

**2026-01-08.** Initial commit: Next.js, Convex, Tailwind. Same day: OPPORTUNITIES.md and homepage improvements; PLAN.md improvement list. Early docs still daydream about a CDN — the product that shipped is the shortener + files.

**2026-01-31 → 02-05.** Sync. Tailwind v4 \`@import\`. Prod build ready.

**2026-02-06.** The spine. Core URL shortening. Upgrade to Next.js 16 and React 19; middleware renamed toward \`proxy.ts\` (and briefly back — Next’s naming war). Convex backend configured and deployed. Clerk auth keys landed.

**2026-02-11.** Dashboard UI improvements — links/files mental model.

**2026-02-15–21.** Docs say \`proxy.ts\`. Footer gets real social URLs. Unused \`posthog-js\` and \`@sentry/nextjs\` leave the lockfile.

**2026-02-27.** Security headers in \`next.config.ts\`. \`sitemap.ts\` / \`robots.ts\`. Error boundaries. Auth checks on links and files mutations.

**2026-03-23.** PR #23 strips \`console.error\` noise.

**2026-05-14–15.** Blacksmith CI standardized. Providers tolerate missing Clerk keys so builds do not die. Deploy URL / health-check fixes.

**2026-08-08.** HEAD \`d6c074f\` — \`vercel.json\` sets \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`. Thirty-eight commits on the clock.

## Why

A short link you do not control is a tax with a dashboard skin. I wanted the domain, the Convex tables, and the redirect that writes analytics before the visitor leaves — on the same Clerk identity I already use everywhere else.

So I put shortening and file hosting on \`s12.in\`, recorded clicks with geo and device fields, and kept shipping until CI and robots headers stopped being the embarrassment.

It is still 0.1.0. Custom codes, password gates, plan limits, and analytics charts sit in schema or queries waiting for UI. Clerk on the observed deploy is still test-mode. That is fine to say out loud. The redirect path and the dashboard list already do the job a rented shortener charges monthly for.

If your current short links cannot show you country and device without opening another product, you already know the hole I was staring at.

What would you put on \`s12.in/yourcode\` first — the campaign URL, the PDF, or the deck you keep resending as a thirty-line Google Drive link?

const THENATIONALNC_COVER =
  "/blog/thenationalnc-live-rss-before-bias-ai/cover.png";

const THENATIONALNC_CONTENT = `![The National NC homepage — LIVE Latest NC News](/blog/thenationalnc-live-rss-before-bias-ai/screenshots/home-live.png)

## Who

I got tired of opening five tabs to see how the same North Carolina story landed in Charlotte, Raleigh, and the wire services — then pretending I had “read around.”

Most “balanced news” products either editorialize or hide the sausage. I wanted a pipe: aggregate first, label leanings when we can prove them, compare coverage when the model earns the pixel.

The National NC is for NC locals and remote watchers who want AP, Reuters, and regional headlines in one dark UI — and for builders who will tolerate an honest placeholder where the AI comparison card still says “coming.”

If you ship Next + Convex + Clerk and care about media literacy without a cable-news costume, you are in the room.

## What

Live at [thenationalnc.com](https://www.thenationalnc.com/). Private repo [HurleyUS/thenationalnc.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/thenationalnc.com). Package **0.1.0**, Bun, Next.js **16.2.6**, React 19, Tailwind 4, Catppuccin Mocha by default.

Stack in the lockfile: Convex, Clerk, PostHog, Sentry, Resend, Radix, lucide, next-themes, Vitest. Payments README still says N/A; freemium (ad-free / advanced comparison) is in the opportunities doc, not a Stripe catalog.

![News feed — Live / Editorial](/blog/thenationalnc-live-rss-before-bias-ai/screenshots/news.png)

What actually works today:

- **\`GET /api/news\`** pulls Google News RSS — AP site query, Reuters site query, NC \`when:3d\` — parses items, filters with 30+ NC city/region/team keywords, dedupes by title similarity, caches **15 minutes** in process memory.
- Homepage embeds a **LIVE** feed with source tabs (All / AP / Reuters / NC News) and refresh.
- \`/news\` defaults to Live; Editorial tab still serves eight demo NC articles with Left / Center / Right badges.
- \`/news/[id]\` renders demo content + related sidebar + an **AI comparison placeholder** — not a live model call.
- Convex \`schema.ts\` defines articles, sources, comparisons, categories (optional embeddings). Deployment not initialized; demo data still wins.

On 2026-09-08 the live API returned **50** NC-relevant headlines in one sample (WXII, Citizen Times, Carolina Journal, WRAL, ABC11, NYT, …). AP/Reuters tabs can show zero when those fetches abort — 8s timeout per feed, independent failure.

![About — mission and L/C/R source lists](/blog/thenationalnc-live-rss-before-bias-ai/screenshots/about.png)

## Where

Public product: [www.thenationalnc.com](https://www.thenationalnc.com/). Vercel alias \`thenationalnc-com.vercel.app\`. Routes: \`/\`, \`/news\`, \`/news/[id]\`, \`/about\`, \`/api/news\`. Robots allow site, disallow \`/api/\`. Sitemap is thin (homepage-weighted) as of last deploy.

Code stays private under HurleyUS. Host Vercel; Blacksmith/prebuilt CI path; \`vercel.json\` disables git auto-deploy on \`main\` and sets \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`.

## When

**2026-01-08.** Scaffold Next + Convex + Tailwind. PLAN and OPPORTUNITIES spell the bias-comparison dream before a single feed parses.

**2026-02-06–08.** Next 16.1.6, Tailwind v4 CSS import fix, wire dead homepage buttons, yank Clerk off the homepage when env keys are missing.

**2026-02-13.** The real jump: Catppuccin dark mode, shared layout, demo news + article pages, Convex schema — and **live NC feeds** through Google News RSS (\`44dfae3\`). That is when the site stopped being a brochure.

**Late February.** Clerk middleware, error boundaries, sitemap/robots, security headers, console → Sentry cleanup.

**March.** Vitest smoke coverage.

**May.** shipprep / Blacksmith CI standardization and deploy URL verification — lots of “Standardize Blacksmith CI gates,” little product surface change.

**2026-08-08.** HEAD \`bfb6723\` — robots index/follow header on Vercel. Thirty-three commits on the clock.

## Why

Bias detection without articles is a slide deck. I wanted the NC headline pipe in production first — cache, filters, source badges, dark UI — so when OpenRouter (or whatever) comparison lands, it has real URLs to argue about.

The gap is intentional and visible: leaning badges on demos, placeholder comparison card, Convex not live yet. Better than fake AI chrome.

When the comparison model finally ships, which NC story do you want side-by-side first — legislature, weather disaster, or Carolina basketball?

const ILEAGUE_COVER =
  "/blog/ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies/cover.png";

const ILEAGUE_CONTENT = `![iLeague.golf homepage mock — Patreon meets 18birdies, Top 54 qualify for iTour](/blog/ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I build products in public for operators, not for pitch decks. Golf creators already duct-tape a scorecard app to a Patreon to a tip jar. Fans already bounce between three tabs to follow a round and pay for the good stuff.

iLeague.golf is for those creators and those fans — and for anyone shipping a Bun monorepo that has to hold a Next.js web app, an Expo companion, and a Convex backend without lying about what is finished.

If you care about creator-economy plumbing, Stripe tier math, or how a generic “influencer” scaffold gets rebranded into a sport vertical: this is the field notes.

## What

I shipped a golf creator platform under \`HurleyUS/ileague.golf\`.

The README line is blunt: **Patreon meets 18birdies**. The live lander says the same badge, then: **Where Golf Creators Build Empires**. Track rounds. Build a following. Get paid through subscriptions and tips. **Top 54** creators qualify for [iTour.golf](https://itour.golf). Winners aim at iConference.

Stack on the box: **Next.js 15.5.9**, React 18.3.1, **Convex**, **Clerk**, **Stripe**, PostHog, Sentry, Resend, Tailwind v4, Bun workspaces, Expo 52 mobile, Phosphor icons via react-icons, Vercel. Package version **1.0.0**. Repo is private. Site is public at [ileague.golf](https://ileague.golf).

![Creator profile mock — followers, subscribers, earnings, content grid](/blog/ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies/screenshots/creator-profile.png)

Monetization is not a slide. It is \`apps/web/src/lib/billing.ts\`:

- Platform fee **15%**
- Tip presets **$5 / $10 / $20 / $50 / $100**
- Suggested creator tiers — Bronze $4.99, Silver $9.99, Gold $24.99 monthly (yearly suggested too)
- Real tiers live in Convex \`subscriptionTiers\` and check out through dynamic Stripe \`price_data\` (web API + Convex actions)

Content model covers video, shorts, images, links, text, and **round recaps** tied to scorecards. Visibility: public / followers / subscribers. Courses, course reviews, rounds (FIR/GIR/putts), standings, leagues, notifications — all in \`convex/schema.ts\`.

What is also true: the dashboard still says **influencers**. Explore still calls \`getInfluencers\`. The README still says **Top 36** while the live hero says **Top 54**. Production HTML still loads Clerk **\`pk_test\`** from a \`*.clerk.accounts.dev\` instance. The scorecard schema is ahead of the hole-entry UI. That is the product, not a footnote.

![Billing mock — Bronze / Silver / Gold + tip presets](/blog/ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies/screenshots/billing-tiers.png)

## Where

It runs on Vercel against Convex. Auth is Clerk. Money is Stripe. Mail is Resend. Errors go to Sentry. Product events go to PostHog. Mobile is Expo with EAS configs and placeholder Apple submit IDs.

Surfaces that matter:

- Public lander — emerald/slate hero, feature grid, creator/fan columns, ecosystem footer
- Auth + onboarding — Clerk sign-in/up, role/profile setup
- App shell — dashboard, explore, leagues, notifications
- Creator profile — \`/creator/[id]\` with hero, featured courses, content grid
- Payments — \`/api/stripe/checkout\`, portal, webhook; Convex \`/stripe-webhook\`

Audience sits with golf creators, golf fans, and builders watching a sport vertical on a creator-economy stack. Sibling properties: iTour.golf and iConference.golf under the HurleyUS lane.

![Scorecard / schema mock — hole-by-hole model vs missing UI](/blog/ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies/screenshots/scorecard.png)

## When

**2026-01-09.** Initial monorepo — web + mobile. Convex stubs. React 19 downgraded to 18 for Clerk/Convex. Vercel monorepo config. First production deploy on a hustle-launch Vercel URL. CHANGELOG also remembers the earlier \`michaelmonetized/ileague-app\` GitHub link.

**January 31.** Chore sync.

**February 4.** Mobile leagues pushed toward Convex. EAS config. Roadmap honesty about hardcoded mobile screens.

**February 11.** HurleyUS repo created. Golf schema and plan. Golf-focused homepage, header, footer, Convex functions. This is the rebrand day — influencer scaffold becomes iLeague.golf.

**February 12–28.** Stripe API version bump. Search indexes. Metadata rewritten for golf. Golf category. lucide → react-icons. Root \`/convex\` consolidation. CI experiments. Mobile TypeScript cleanup. Vercel as the only CI/CD.

**March.** Security headers. Middleware runtime fights. **www vs apex redirect loop** — normalize middleware, dual aliases, then disable middleware so Vercel stops bouncing. robots.txt, sitemap, trending creators carousel. Stripe checkout patterns standardized. **Creator profile page** ships. Dashboard starts showing real follower/subscriber/earnings stats. Convex package versions aligned.

**May 14–15.** Blacksmith CI gate spam, then removed.

**May 21.** Production Convex crash fix. Missing creator queries for the lander and profile pages. Stripe/Resend factories so deploy analysis does not need live keys. CSP \`worker-src\`. CHANGELOG **1.0.4**.

**June 22.** Nightly commits.

**August 8, 6:55 AM ET.** HEAD \`508df8e\` — set \`X-Robots-Tag\` to \`index, follow\` on Vercel. Fifty-four commits on \`main\`.

**September 8 pack day.** Live site returns 200. Robots tag present. Clerk still on test keys. Draft only.

![Ecosystem mock — iLeague → iTour → iConference](/blog/ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies/screenshots/ecosystem.png)

## When (clock)

Fifty-four commits. January 9 to August 8. HEAD \`508df8e\`. Private monorepo. Public emerald lander.

## Why

Creator tools fail in two directions: beautiful landers with no money path, or Stripe dashboards with no sport-specific object model. I wanted both — scorecards that can become content, tiers that can become iTour qualification, tips that are not a third-party link-in-bio.

I also refused to pretend the rebrand was complete. Influencer function names, Top 36 vs Top 54, and \`pk_test\` on a real domain are operator signals. They tell you where the product still is.

The ecosystem bet is explicit: iLeague feeds iTour feeds iConference. This pack is only the first node.

If you create golf content today, what would you rather ship next on iLeague — a real hole-by-hole entry flow, or flipping Clerk to live keys so the first paying subscriber is not on test mode?

const HURLEYUS_COM_CONTENT = `![Hurley US homepage — Membership Growth for Private & Resort Golf Clubs](/blog/hurleyus-com-membership-growth-parent-site/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I run Hurley US as the parent company for a golf-media and SaaS portfolio. Clubs do not buy a story about the future of golf. They buy membership revenue.

This site is for private and resort club operators who treat acquisition as a lever, and for builders who want to see how a parent domain can stop performing brand theater and still keep the ecosystem pages in the repo.

## What

I shipped hurleyus.com — private repo under HurleyUS, public site on Vercel.

Live \`/\` mounts **HomeA**: membership growth for private and resort golf clubs. Compensation tied to incremental revenue. No upfront fees. Call CTA to (828) 269-8280. Named proof: Linville Land Harbor Golf Club and Laurel Ridge Resort & Country Club. Sticky mobile call bar.

Stack at HEAD (\`ac2327f\`, package.json **0.1.0**): **Next.js 16.1.6**, React 19, Bun, Tailwind v4, shadcn/Radix, Resend, Sentry, Convex client that no-ops without a real \`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL\`, PostHog that no-ops without a key. README still says Next 15 — deps say 16.

![About — Hurley US](/blog/hurleyus-com-membership-growth-parent-site/screenshots/about.png)

Still in the tree: **HomeB** — Growing the game together, iLeague / iTour / iCon pillars. Not what \`/\` renders today.

Lead forms on partners / sponsors / investors / contact hit \`/api/email\` with Zod validation and an in-memory IP rate limit (5/min). Booking hits \`/api/booking\` and emails an ICS. From: \`notify@uncap.us\`. Owner: \`contact@hurleyus.com\`.

Clerk routes \`/sign-in\` \`/sign-up\` are TODO stubs — **no \`@clerk/*\` in package.json**. Stripe exists as a cursor rule doc, not a dependency.

![Partners](/blog/hurleyus-com-membership-growth-parent-site/screenshots/partners.png)

## Where

Production: [www.hurleyus.com](https://www.hurleyus.com). Apex 301 to www. Verified 2026-09-08: \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`, CSP, HSTS, sitemap for home + partners/investors/sponsors/about/contact.

Quirk: root layout metadata still titles the site Growing the game together while the body is HomeA — \`page.tsx\` imports HomeA without re-exporting its metadata.

![Contact](/blog/hurleyus-com-membership-growth-parent-site/screenshots/contact.png)

## When

**2025-11-25.** Create Next App.

**December 2025.** Theme, copy, A/B homepage (membership lander vs media ecosystem).

**2026-02-05.** Page-B set as permanent homepage. Within two weeks the split collapses; \`/\` is HomeA only. Resend from notify@uncap.us. Booking form. Static/ISR pass.

**2026-02-22 → 04-03.** Convex schema typed. Messaging Phases 1–3 through real-time subscriptions.

**2026-05-13 → 15.** shipprep + Blacksmith CI + deploy health.

**2026-08-08.** \`ac2327f\` — X-Robots-Tag index, follow. 109 commits total.

## Why

A parent domain that only tells the influencer story leaves club operators with nothing to buy. HomeA is the commercial door: own the acquisition pipeline, get paid on incremental membership revenue, stay discreet.

I kept HomeB in the repo because iLeague / iTour / iCon are real product mythology — just not the \`/\` bet right now. The A/B history is on the record: we tried always-B, then shipped always-A.

The stack is honest: Convex and PostHog degrade. Clerk is a TODO. Stripe is a doc. Indexing was the last commit because a public site still needs to be findable.

const WAYNESVILLE_ZAXBYS_COVER =
  "/blog/waynesville-zaxbys-single-store-ops-portal/cover.png";

const WAYNESVILLE_ZAXBYS_CONTENT = `![Waynesville public lander composite from repo event assets](/blog/waynesville-zaxbys-single-store-ops-portal/screenshots/landing-composite.png)

## Who

I kept watching one store — 424 Russ Avenue, Waynesville, NC — try to be three products at once: a community lander for locals and tourists, a hiring funnel, and a shift office that still lived in spreadsheets, Steritech PDFs, and whoever answered the group text first.

Not the multi-unit franchise SaaS story. That sibling already has its own pack. This one is for the GM and shift leaders who need lunch daypart labor against a ≤17% goal before the dinner rush, and for the parent looking up Kids Night on the same domain.

If you run MarTech by day and still care whether a CAP finding has an observation → cause → prevention trail, you are in the room. If you only want a pricing page with fake “500+ locations,” go read the other post.

## What

I built a **single-store** Zaxby's management and customer portal.

Public surface (\`app/(public)\`): home with local events (Wheelin' Wednesdays, bounce party, Kids Night), about, careers + apply, catering (redirects to corporate catering), community, events, menu (redirects to zaxbys.com menu), contact. Store truth lives in \`_project.ts\` — **424 Russ Avenue**, Waynesville NC 28786, phone **828-456-2888**, email \`eat@waynesville.yourzaxbys.com\`, hours 10:30–21:00, dayparts lunch / snack / dinner / late.

![Ops map — public, shift, people, numbers](/blog/waynesville-zaxbys-single-store-ops-portal/screenshots/ops-map-composite.png)

Private surface: \`/dashboard\` with live shift, performance, metrics (including SOS and SMG pages), goals and 6-week trends, hiring Kanban, schedule + swaps + time-off, daypart checklists, Steritech CAP reports, training sessions + Zaxby's University tracking, attendance + points, leadership scores, maintenance, uniforms/smallwares orders, announcements, events CRUD, and CSV ingest under \`/dashboard/injest\`.

Convex is the spine — thirty-plus modules, not a toy schema. Employees, applicants, shifts, metrics daily/weekly/periodic, caps, checklists, training/ZU progress, attendance points, orders. Package name matches the host: **\`waynesville.yourzaxbys.com\` \`0.1.0\`**. Stack: Next **16.1.6**, React 19, Convex, Clerk, Resend + React Email, Sentry, PostHog, Radix + Tailwind 4, Bun, Blacksmith \`ship.yml\`.

![Illustrative live-shift dashboard composite](/blog/waynesville-zaxbys-single-store-ops-portal/screenshots/dashboard-composite.png)

Honesty checks: sitrep still whispers WIP and “maybe superseded by www.” HEAD has more store-ops depth than the franchise sibling. Custom domain \`waynesville.yourzaxbys.com\` did **not** resolve from pack hosts. Vercel alias answered with a **429 bot challenge** — no clean live screenshot, so composites are labeled. README growth notes and franchise-purchase storytelling are provenance in the repo, not a title search I ran. AUTOPSY roasted missing SEO files; HEAD has \`manifest.ts\`, \`sitemap.ts\`, \`robots.ts\`.

## Where

Code: [github.com/HurleyUS/waynesville.yourzaxbys.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/waynesville.yourzaxbys.com). **Private.** Empty description. Empty topics. Zero stars.

GitHub homepage field: [waynesvilleyourzaxbyscom.vercel.app](https://waynesvilleyourzaxbyscom.vercel.app). Alias host resolves; HTTPS challenged at pack time. Canonical claim \`https://waynesville.yourzaxbys.com/\` sits in \`_project.ts\` and README — DNS unresolved here.

Sibling franchise platform (already packed): [www.yourzaxbys.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/www.yourzaxbys.com). Same family. Different job. Platform sells above-store; this repo runs **one** store’s public face and back-office.

The audience sits next to every independent franchisee who needs store software that knows Russ Avenue dayparts — and next to every builder who can smell a “restaurant dashboard” template that never met a Steritech CAP form.

## When

**2025-05-02.** Create Next App → init → first Vercel deploy. Repo created on GitHub the same day. Package starts as a location product, not a SaaS brochure.

**2025-05 → 08.** Fonts, navbar, employee headway, image upload fights, ranking UI. The slow work of making a store site feel like a store.

**2025-10-16 → 10-21.** Security and Convex hardening week. Secure server-side SSN verification. External-link \`rel\` discipline. Full-text employee search. Build compilation fixes for production.

**2026-01-03 → 01-04.** Dashboard redesign — Spotify Wrapped energy, scroll snap, metrics tables that calculate labor %, LY comparisons, placeholder rows for the current week, double-click cell edits, charts with 6-week averages and goals.

**2026-01-08 → 01-09.** The suite ships in a day: CSV import/reporting, employee onboarding/self-registration, Indeed hiring Kanban, live shift dashboard, shift checklists, announcements, scheduling, uniforms/smallwares, Steritech CAP, training agendas, attendance tracker — then a training rebuild with scheduled sessions and ZU course tracking.

**2026-01-12.** Delete buttons and missing-week detection on metrics. Practical GM requests.

**2026-02-15 → 02-26.** Security that matters: remove hardcoded encryption key fallback; fix proxy middleware that had made routes public; encrypt SSN at rest AES-256-GCM (#34/#41); strip SSN context from console logs (#43/#50); enforce auth on Convex public mutations (#42/#51).

**2026-03-21.** Remaining \`console.*\` → Sentry logging (#53).

**2026-05-14.** Blacksmith CI gates standardized across a stack of commits. Clerk/email client check fixes. Lazy Resend. Skip Convex provider without public env.

**2026-08-08.** \`fix: set X-Robots-Tag to index, follow on Vercel\`. HEAD **\`c9f97b7\`**. Two hundred thirty-five commits on the ledger. Pack day is September 8, 2026.

That is the journey from a May Create-Next-App on Russ Avenue to a versioned single-store ops portal that still wears package **0.1.0** like an honest scar.

## Why

I did not want one location’s public community face and its shift office to keep living on different planets.

So I put events and careers on the same origin as live dayparts, Steritech CAPs, hiring, training, and attendance. I put Clerk on the door and Convex under the floor. I left package **0.1.0** because “store software that GMs touch” is not the same milestone as a franchise SaaS **1.0.0** marketing claim. I left the sibling relationship explicit: www is the platform pack; this is the store pack.

sitrep can keep saying LOW priority. The git log disagrees with “empty.” The schema disagrees with “template.”

If your current “location site” folder has a hero image and no checklist submission table — or a dashboard route and a proxy that accidentally made everything public — you already know which hole I was staring at.

Would you point real DNS at this alias and run a week of live shift entry next — or keep the franchise platform and the store portal honest as two products with two jobs?

const MODERN_DESIGN_PLAYGROUND_COVER =
  "/blog/modern-design-playground-afk-webgl-nine-worlds/cover.png";

const MODERN_DESIGN_PLAYGROUND_CONTENT = `![Modern Design Playground — WebGL home instrument](/blog/modern-design-playground-afk-webgl-nine-worlds/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I do not want another marketing landing that scrolls like a PDF with bounce.

I want an instrument. Pointer gravity. Camera dolly. A stage that listens when you strike it.

modern-design-playground is for operators who already live in Max type, Catppuccin surfaces, and shadcn primitives — and who have watched a WebGL canvas go black after an HDRI 404 and refused to ship the apology screenshot.

It is also for anyone curious what happens when you leave agents AFK with a Playwright density score and a mandate to polish the weakest PNG.

## What

I built **Modern Design Playground** — Vite 8, React 19, TanStack Router, Three.js + R3F, GSAP, Lenis, Motion, Tailwind 4, shadcn base-nova, Max fonts. Private package, unversioned. Nine commits. HEAD \`d16a7e3\`.

Home \`/\` is one continuous WebGL field. Liquid core. Cosmic backdrop. Helix of archive plates that becomes a tunnel. Strike the field. Hold to resonate. Glass / metal / matte. Case study sheet. \`Stage.tsx\` ~1k lines. \`Chapters.tsx\` ~1.4k.

![Landing gallery — nine instruments, zero templates](/blog/modern-design-playground-afk-webgl-nine-worlds/screenshots/landings-gallery.png)

\`/landings\` is nine worlds, not nine templates: editorial, brutalist, noir, zen, neon, paper, atlas, pulse, prism. \`pages.tsx\` is **10,682 lines** of CSS micro-theaters. Immersive routes hide the site chrome.

The honest middle of the story: on July 12 the homepage WebGL died. Remote HDRI Environment suspended the scene. CDN 404s. Postprocessing wiped alpha to zero. I did not hand-paint a hero. I left a marathon — iterate-loop, marathon-forever, smoke-interact — screenshot every surface, score by PNG density, upgrade the weakest, repeat for ~10 hours while I was AFK. STATUS-MARATHON.md is the log. Opaque clear \`#11111b\`. Local lights. No EffectComposer on the home stage. Liquid core came back.

![Brutalist world — paint floor instrument](/blog/modern-design-playground-afk-webgl-nine-worlds/screenshots/landing-brutalist.png)

July 14 I shoved it onto Vercel as a static SPA, ripped Clerk, stripped Convex/PostHog providers for performance. August 8 I set \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`. Live host: **https://mdp-seven.vercel.app**.

## Where

Live on Vercel: https://mdp-seven.vercel.app — home instrument, \`/landings\`, \`/landings/{slug}\`.

Repo: https://github.com/michaelmonetized/modern-design-playground

This is not twelveux (hosted shadcn registry + Glass). Not HMS (live-edit CMS). Sibling energy to uncap stills in the helix — different product surface.

## When

**2026-07-12, 10:39 ET.** \`baa3c67\` init.

**That afternoon into night.** Marathon AFK ~12:00 → ~23:00 ET. Passes A–I. WebGL repaired. Nine worlds densified. Commit \`06d6555\` next morning: *speechless, requires a full case study and log analysis*.

**2026-07-14.** Push fixes. \`.debug-screenshots\` gitignored. Deploy to Vercel. SSR → static SPA. Clerk out. Performance strip.

**2026-08-08, 06:55 ET.** \`d16a7e3\` robots index/follow. HEAD. Nine commits total.

## Why

I wanted proof that scroll can be an instrument and that an agent loop with screenshot density as the scoreboard can recover a dead WebGL stage without me babysitting every frame.

So the pack is the playground plus the marathon scar. The live URL is the proof. The STATUS log is the receipt.

If your hero is still a paused MP4 pretending to be 3D, you already know the hole I was staring at.

Which world would you open first after the instrument — brutalist, neon, or zen?

const DJSIDETHREE_COVER =

const DJSIDETHREE_CONTENT = `![DJ Side Three homepage hero](/blog/djsidethree-wnc-wedding-dj-funnel-after-clerk-cut/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I wanted a wedding DJ site for Western North Carolina that did not hide the price behind “request a quote” theater.

Couples in Asheville, Boone, and Highlands still get Instagram DMs and PDF menus. I wanted a one-pager: soundtrack promise up top, three packages with numbers, availability form at the bottom, admin board for whoever answers the phone.

This is for engaged couples shopping entertainment, for venues that need a link that is not a Linktree, and for operators who will ship Convex inquiries before they cosplay a full SaaS auth stack.

If you build local-service Next apps and have watched Clerk + CAPTCHA + Sentry take down a marketing page with a 500, you are in the room.

## What

Live at [djsidethree.com](https://www.djsidethree.com/). Private repo [HurleyUS/djsidethree.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/djsidethree.com). Package **djsideThree** **0.1.0**, Bun, Next.js **16.2.6**, React 19, Tailwind 4, purple/pink on black.

Lockfile reality: Convex, Resend, PostHog, Stripe, Phosphor, Zod, React Hook Form, next-themes. README still lists Clerk/Sentry/Radix from the scaffold era — those got cut or never shipped in the live tree.

![Services — ceremony, reception, lighting](/blog/djsidethree-wnc-wedding-dj-funnel-after-clerk-cut/screenshots/services.png)

What the page actually sells:

- **Ceremony** from **$500** — sound, two wireless mics, prelude/processional/recessional, officiant coordination
- **Reception** from **$1,200** (Most Popular) — four-hour DJ, lighting, MC, requests, cocktail hour, backup gear
- **Full Day** from **$1,500** — ceremony + reception, up to eight hours, upgraded lighting, rehearsal/timeline help

![Wedding packages $500 / $1200 / $1500](/blog/djsidethree-wnc-wedding-dj-funnel-after-clerk-cut/screenshots/packages.png)

Inquiry path: \`#contact\` form → Zod client validation → Convex \`inquiries.create\` (future date check, normalize email, **3/email/hour** server rate limit, Resend notification schedule). Client also throttles resubmits to 60 seconds. Testimonials pull approved Convex rows or fall back to three static couple quotes. \`/admin\` shows New / Contacted / Booked / Total — on 2026-09-08 capture: all zeros and skeleton rows (no live inquiry data in that session).

![Check Availability inquiry form](/blog/djsidethree-wnc-wedding-dj-funnel-after-clerk-cut/screenshots/contact.png)

Honesty: hero claims **200+** weddings / **5.0** / **10+** years are marketing copy. Footer phone is \`(828) 555-0123\`. Stripe is a dependency and a Cursor rule, not a deposit checkout on the page. Clerk identity checks remain in Convex admin functions after the Clerk provider was removed — the admin board is not “secure by UI hope.”

## Where

Public product: [www.djsidethree.com](https://www.djsidethree.com/) (apex 307s to www). Vercel alias \`djsidethree-com.vercel.app\`. Routes: \`/\`, \`/admin\`. Single-page anchors: \`#services\` \`#packages\` \`#testimonials\` \`#contact\`.

Code stays private under HurleyUS. Host Vercel; Blacksmith/prebuilt CI path in May; HEAD sets \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`.

## When

**2026-01-08.** Scaffold Next + Convex + Tailwind. Same day: OPPORTUNITIES/PLAN, then **complete DJ landing MVP** — hero, services, packages, testimonials, contact — plus seed script, Resend path, and admin dashboard. That is the product surface.

**2026-02-06–13.** Next 16 / React 19, Tailwind v4 CSS import fix, Convex generated types, dark mode defaults, build/design-rule cleanup.

**2026-02-21–22.** Hardening week: inquiry auth checks + validation, focus rings, label associations, mobile hamburger, skeletons, Phosphor instead of lucide, Zod + rate limiting, Turnstile CAPTCHA, Server Component extract for static sections, Clerk middleware on \`/admin\`.

**2026-02-27.** The plot twist: **\`fix: remove Clerk, Turnstile, and Sentry — fix production 500 error\`** (\`be461fc\`). Auth/CAPTCHA/error-tracking chrome was cheaper to delete than to keep misconfigured in prod.

**Late Feb → early March.** P1 security follow-ups, inquiry rate limit **3/email/hour**, env validation fail-fast.

**May.** Seven “Standardize Blacksmith CI gates” commits plus deploy URL verification — CI theater, little marketing surface change.

**2026-08-08.** HEAD \`2c804ad\` — robots index/follow header. Forty-three commits on the clock.

## Why

A wedding DJ site that hides price and inquiry behind “book a call” is a brochure. I wanted packages and a form in production first.

When Clerk + Turnstile + Sentry 500’d the marketing page, I cut them. Zod, rate limits, Phosphor, and the Convex inquiry shape stayed. Deposits and real admin auth can earn their way back — the soundtrack page should not die for missing keys.

Would you keep an unprotected \`/admin\` board after ripping Clerk, or is a single shared secret / Convex auth identity the next Saturday morning?

const EVERYTHINGMONETIZED_COVER =

const EVERYTHINGMONETIZED_CONTENT = `![EverythingMonetized live hero — Cohort 04 parody LMS academy redesign](/blog/everythingmonetized-parody-lms-course-bros/screenshots/home-live.png)

## Who

I build products in public for operators who can smell a funnel from across the room. The course economy already sells the same promise on a loop: buy a course about making money by selling courses about making money. Fans of that bit — and builders who want the satire to have a real schema — are who this is for.

If you already read the MerchWinner pack (POD course marketplace, empty catalog) or iLeague (golf creator Stripe), this is a different lane. EverythingMonetized is intentional parody of the guru machine, not a commerce vertical wearing a joke title.

## What

I shipped a parody LMS under \`HurleyUS/everythingmonetized.com\`.

README one-liner: **Parody site where AI generated course bros sell course bro courses to aspiring course bros.** Live metadata: **Where Course Bros Monetize Everything.** The May 22 redesign hero is blunter: **The parody LMS for learning how the course economy sells itself.**

Stack on the box: **Next.js 16.2.6**, React 19.2.6, **Convex**, Tailwind v4, Phosphor, Framer Motion, Radix, next-themes (dark default), PostHog, Sentry, Resend. Bun. Package **everythingmonetized** **0.1.0**. Private HurleyUS repo. Public site at [www.everythingmonetized.com](https://www.everythingmonetized.com).

![Illustrative course catalog — 9 of 10 seeded absurd titles](/blog/everythingmonetized-parody-lms-course-bros/screenshots/courses.png)

Convex schema is the product spine:

- \`courseBros\` — name, slug, tagline, bio, catchphrases, specialties, socialProof, featured
- \`courses\` — absurd titles, inflated \`originalPrice\`, modules/lessons, category, search index
- \`testimonials\` — always-verified parody outcomes
- \`subscribers\` — newsletter with email dedupe + source
- \`purchases\` — pending/completed/refunded; paymentMethod includes **exposure**
- \`rateLimits\` — newsletter + purchase mutations

Seed ships **5** AI gurus (Chad Hustlemax, Brandon Scale, Tiffany Funnel, Derek Dropship, Maximilian Leverage) and **10** courses from $2,997 to $8,997 — titles like *How to Find Your First Course Idea (By Buying This Course)* and *Mindset Mastery: Think Rich, Stay Poor (Until You Buy This)*. Avatars and thumbs are Pollinations prompt URLs.

Admin is a full CRUD plane: bros, courses, testimonials, subscribers. Auth is a **password cookie** (\`ADMIN_PASSWORD\`, fail-secure after Feb 15). \`@clerk/nextjs\` sits in package.json; public Clerk billing is README fiction — TODO from Feb 13 says no Clerk auth.

Purchase success copy is the thesis: congratulations, course bro — **no actual course will be delivered**. Commitment to the bit is the product.

![Illustrative course detail — High-Ticket Alchemy parody checkout](/blog/everythingmonetized-parody-lms-course-bros/screenshots/course-detail.png)

What is also true on pack day: the live \`/courses\` page says **Showing 0 of 0 courses**. Seed exists. Production Convex is empty or unconfigured. TODO still blocks on GitHub issue #1 — Convex env vars on Vercel. sitrep.md still claims PROTOTYPE / last commit Jan 31 / LOW priority. README still says Next 15.5.6. That drift is the story, not a footnote.

## Where

It runs on Vercel. Apex \`everythingmonetized.com\` 307s to www. Alias \`everythingmonetized-com.vercel.app\` also 200. \`vercel.json\` disables git auto-deploy on main/master and, as of Aug 8, sends \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`.

Surfaces that matter:

- Public lander — teal academy hero, learning-dashboard.tsx card, featured tracks, faculty, learner outcomes, weekly lab newsletter
- Catalog — search / category / price / sort / pagination
- Bro profiles — \`/bros/[slug]\`
- Course detail — modules + parody purchase form
- About — mission + core values (Hustle Over Health, etc.)
- Admin — password gate via \`proxy.ts\`

Audience sits with satire builders, MarTech operators, and anyone comparing a seeded Convex backend to a live empty catalog.

![Live courses page — Showing 0 of 0](/blog/everythingmonetized-parody-lms-course-bros/screenshots/courses-live.png)

## When

**2026-01-08.** Initial Next.js + Convex + Tailwind. OPPORTUNITIES.md and PLAN.md the same day — the bit was named early.

**January 31.** Chore sync.

**February 6.** Next.js 16 + React 19. Tailwind v4 \`@import\` fix.

**February 8.** The product day. Admin panel, tests, search/filter/SEO, edit pages — CHANGELOG **0.1.0** lists five tables, parody purchase, Pollinations images, 48 unit tests, Playwright config, PostHog, Sentry, rate limits.

**February 13.** Production readiness: BUILDING.md button compliance, dark mode via next-themes, \`proxy.ts\` naming for Next 16.

**February 15.** Security: remove hardcoded admin password + fallback. Fail closed if \`ADMIN_PASSWORD\` missing.

**February 21.** lucide → \`@phosphor-icons/react\`.

**April 6.** ESLint / vitest chore.

**May 13–15.** shipprep + Blacksmith CI gate spam, then deploy health URL fixes. Same CI noise pattern as sibling HurleyUS templates — but this repo already had the Feb product pass underneath.

**May 22.** **redesign.** Teal/slate academy UI on home, cards, header/footer, newsletter. Orange hustle-gradient brand in DESIGN.md becomes the light-theme leftover; dark default is the live look.

**August 8, 6:54 AM ET.** HEAD \`e7c6a61\` — \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`. Thirty-one commits on \`main\`.

**September 8 pack day.** Live lander matches redesign. Catalog still 0/0. Draft only.

![Illustrative faculty row — five AI course-bro operators](/blog/everythingmonetized-parody-lms-course-bros/screenshots/bros.png)

## Why

Satire of the course economy fails when it is only a landing meme. It needs personas, a catalog, an admin plane, and a checkout that confesses the joke. I wanted that spine in Convex — not a static joke page.

I also refused to pretend production was seeded. Robots say index,follow. Courses say 0 of 0. Seed.ts says ten high-ticket absurdities. Those three sentences together are the operator note.

If you ship a parody LMS next, what do you fix first — seed Convex so the bit has inventory, or leave Showing 0 of 0 as the meta punchline?

const CRAVEES_COVER =

const CRAVEES_CONTENT = `![Cravees home — Turn hungry searches into booked tables](/blog/cravees-catering-martech-agency-site/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I got tired of watching catering businesses buy generic agency retainers that treat a wedding buffet like a SaaS landing page.

Catering is feast-or-famine. Wedding season starts when venues book. Corporate lunch messaging is not private-event messaging. Deposit timing matters. A Google Business profile can become tasting appointments — or a photo graveyard.

Cravees is for caterers and restaurant catering arms who need demand this month: inquiry lift, reorder lists, review velocity. Operators who want a vertical agency site on a real stack — Next, Convex, Clerk, Stripe — with lead status enums that survive a failed Resend delivery. Builders who will admit the public pricing cards and the Stripe \`planSlug\` ladder are not the same numbers yet.

If you have ever explained to a marketing generalist why plated service and buffet are different offers, you are in the room.

## What

I built **Cravees** — package name \`cravees\`, version **0.1.0**, private under **HurleyUS/cravees.com**. Metadata line: *Marketing Agency for the Catering Industry*. Hero line: **Turn hungry searches into booked tables, events, and repeat orders.**

Stack facts from the lockfile and tree, not the stale sitrep: **Next.js 16.2.6**, **React 19.2.6**, **Tailwind 4.3**, Bun, **Convex** schema + mutations, **Clerk** auth surfaces, **Stripe** checkout/portal/webhook, Catppuccin Mocha with peach primary, Resend/Sentry/PostHog/GA wired. Seventy-three commits. HEAD \`ab0c4cb\`.

![Pricing — Starter Growth Premium](/blog/cravees-catering-martech-agency-site/screenshots/pricing.png)

Surfaces that exist in \`app/\`: \`/\` marketing with demand cockpit + case studies + testimonials + FAQ + ROI embed, \`/about\`, \`/pricing\` with comparison table, \`/blog\` + three SEO posts, \`/contact\` enhanced form (business type + service interests), \`/book\` Calendly, \`/roi-calculator\`, four \`/services/*\` landings, Clerk catch-alls, private \`/dashboard\` (+ messages, assets), newsletter + Stripe API routes.

Convex tables: \`leads\`, \`subscribers\`, \`clients\`, \`subscriptions\`, \`addOnPurchases\`. Lead pipeline: **new → contacted → qualified → proposal → won | lost**. Public packages: Starter **$299**, Growth **$599**, Premium **$999**. Stripe definitions in \`lib/billing.ts\`: Bronze **$499**, Silver **$999**, Gold **$1,999** (+ annual labels). Add-ons: extra social post $49, rush design $199, additional listing $99.

That dual ladder is not a typo in this write-up. It is the product honesty.

## Where

Code lives at [github.com/HurleyUS/cravees.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/cravees.com) — **private**. GitHub homepage points at [cravees-com.vercel.app](https://cravees-com.vercel.app). Custom domain [www.cravees.com](https://www.cravees.com) also **200** at pack time. Apex redirects to www. Auth-gated \`/dashboard\` and \`/sign-in\` returned **500** without living Clerk keys — marketing stays up because May commits taught the app to tolerate missing auth/env.

Audience sits next to restaurant marketing shops, with a catering-only pitch: inquiry funnels, seasonal search pages, winback email for lapsed brunch guests. Sibling operator furniture is present — \`.hustlemc\`, Blacksmith ship workflow, Vitest/Playwright, Stripe type-safe webhooks.

**Pack day 2026-09-08.** Draft and assets only. Live marketing 200 on vercel + www. \`sitrep.md\` still claims purpose unclear and last commit February 5 — treat it as drift, not truth.

![Blog index — three catering posts](/blog/cravees-catering-martech-agency-site/screenshots/blog.png)

## Why

I did not want another hospitality brochure with stock plate photography and a contact form that emails into the void.

I wanted lead status enums next to subscription sync. I wanted an ROI calculator that routes into the same contact pipeline as the pricing CTA. I wanted newsletter double opt-in and a client portal sidebar even while \`/dashboard\` still 500s without Clerk. I wanted the public $299/$599/$999 story and the Stripe bronze/silver/gold amounts to be visible in the same repo so nobody pretends they already match.

So the February issue board became the agency: close FAQ, social proof, pricing table, blog, book, analytics, ROI, newsletter, portal. March hardened SEO and Stripe. May made the public site survive missing secrets. August flipped robots headers on a site that actually answers.

If your catering marketing pitch promises “full-service growth” and your \`leads\` table cannot say \`qualified\`, you already know the hole I was staring at.

Would you ship the public Starter/Growth/Premium ladder first, or make the Stripe bronze/silver/gold amounts match the pricing page before the next catering discovery call?

const COORDINATORAPP_CONTENT = `![Coordinator home — Reliable queues for the APIs your product depends on](/blog/coordinatorapp-api-queue-control-plane/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I got tired of watching production workers invent their own Stripe and GitHub throttles.

Every SaaS eventually grows a Friday-night 429 story. Someone hard-codes a sleep. Someone else adds a Redis queue “just for this provider.” Zapier looks fine until flood protection is the product and connector count is the brochure.

Coordinator is for operators who want a **hosted control plane** for rate limits, retries, backoff, and replay — before they pretend the SDK already ships. Production teams who need queue depth and provider health readable in one zinc panel. Builders comparing Zapier / Make / n8n on backpressure instead of logo walls.

If you have ever paused a HubSpot sync because the provider blinked, you are in the room.

## What

I built **Coordinator** — package name \`coordinatorapp\`, version **0.1.0**, private under **HurleyUS/coordinatorapp.com**. Metadata: *Smart API Queueing & Rate Limiting*. Tagline energy: **Connect. Queue. Execute.** Hero: **Reliable queues for the APIs your product depends on.**

Stack facts from the lockfile and tree, not the stale sitrep: **Next.js 16.2.6**, **React 19.2.6**, **Tailwind 4.3**, Bun, **Convex**, **Clerk**, **Stripe** checkout/portal/webhook with dynamic \`price_data\`, Sentry, PostHog, GA. Fifty-two commits. HEAD \`b7e9b3b\`.

![Live pricing — Free / $29 / $79](/blog/coordinatorapp-api-queue-control-plane/screenshots/pricing.png)

Surfaces that exist: \`/\` zinc lander with DashboardPreview (24,891 queued / 1,204 429s prevented / 2.4s retry; Stripe / GitHub / HubSpot rows), \`/pricing\`, \`/docs\` (every guide card says Coming soon), \`/privacy\`, \`/terms\`, \`/sign-in\`, \`/sign-up\`, \`/events/[eventId]\`, Stripe API routes under \`app/api/stripe/\`.

Convex tables: \`waitlist\`, \`events\`, \`attendees\`, \`users\`, \`subscriptions\`, \`addOnPurchases\`. Waitlist mutation + \`WaitlistForm\` exist — **not wired into the May redesign homepage**. Event RSVP (Mar 20 #31) tracks capacity, dietary notes, confirmed/tentative/cancelled.

![Billing drift — pricing page vs lib/billing.ts](/blog/coordinatorapp-api-queue-control-plane/screenshots/billing-drift.png)

Money path split brain: **live pricing page** sells Starter Free / Pro **$29**/user/mo / Business **$79**/user/mo. **\`lib/billing.ts\`** (what checkout reads) prices Starter **$19**, Pro **$49**, Business **$149**, plus Extra Executions **$19** and Priority Support **$99**. OPPORTUNITIES still promises an **n8n** backend. There is **no n8n** in the tree. Homepage teases \`coordinator.queue(...)\` — the SDK is marketing, not a package.

## Where

Code: [github.com/HurleyUS/coordinatorapp.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/coordinatorapp.com) — **private**. Live: [www.coordinatorapp.com](https://www.coordinatorapp.com) (**HTTP 200**, apex 307→www). GitHub homepage: [coordinatorapp-com.vercel.app](https://coordinatorapp-com.vercel.app) (same prerender etag). \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` from the Aug 8 \`vercel.json\` fix.

![Docs — Coming soon](/blog/coordinatorapp-api-queue-control-plane/screenshots/docs.png)

![SDK teaser on the lander](/blog/coordinatorapp-api-queue-control-plane/screenshots/sdk-snippet.png)

## Why

I did not want another automation brochure with a fake connector grid and no backoff story.

I wanted a control plane face — queued requests, 429s prevented, retry delay — before the worker existed. I wanted Stripe subscription sync and Convex waitlist/events on disk even while docs say Coming soon and the homepage SDK call is a \`<pre>\`.

So January named the category. February shipped the face. March fought www 500s, captured waitlist emails, bolted on event RSVP, and hardened Stripe. May redesign locked the zinc hero. August flipped robots on a live site that still needs Clerk env vars.

If your integration platform README promises n8n power and your repo has zero n8n, you already know the hole I was staring at.

Would you fix the pricing page to match \`billing.ts\`, or ship Clerk keys to www before anyone can Start with GitHub?
`;

const HURLEYMC_COVER =
  "/blog/hurley-mission-control-human-agent-comms/cover.png";

const HURLEYMC_CONTENT = `## Who

I run agents and humans on the same company. Slack does not know what an agent is. A terminal log does not know what a delivery receipt is. The Go repo named mission-control is a p10k-inspired TUI for deploys and git status. Hustle Launch mission-control-os is a different product. This room is the HurleyUS comms plane.

This piece is for operators who need a human and an agent in the same membership list. For people who want queued/delivered/failed rows next to a message instead of hoping a webhook fired. For anyone who has already confused the three Mission Control names in this portfolio and needs the cut named out loud.

## What

I shipped Hurley Mission Control — a public HurleyUS repo whose README says the quiet part: unified comms plane for agents and humans.

Stack facts: Next.js 16.2.1 App Router, React 19.2, Clerk, Convex, TypeScript, cmdk and framer-motion in the lockfile, package name flattened to \`web\` after the monorepo fight, packageManager bun@latest, local port 3410.

![Dashboard — threads with dm group project ops kinds](/blog/hurley-mission-control-human-agent-comms/screenshots/dashboard-threads.png)

The Convex schema is the product. users.kind is human or agent. Agents can carry agentId and machineId. Threads are dm, group, project, or ops. Messages support replyTo and optional type text|event|system. sendMessage checks clientMessageId before insert so retries do not double-post. Deliveries fan out to other members as queued rows with attempts and lastError. Presence tracks online and lastSeenAt.

The web path is a thread grid with kind icons, a detail route for the feed, optimistic yellow sending states in the sprint writeup, and a quick-stats strip that literally advertises 2s message refresh. getThreads still collects all threads and filters membership in the handler — honest, not cute.

Auth is hybrid. Clerk packages are real. useUser also reads localStorage userId and testUserId and can POST /api/sync-user to mint a Convex user for sprint testing without the full Clerk dance. The live root paints Redirecting... and aims at sign-in when that key is missing. Title in the document: HurleyUS Mission Control.

![Daemon stub and OpenClaw plugin WIP](/blog/hurley-mission-control-human-agent-comms/screenshots/daemon-plugin-wip.png)

Honesty on the edges: apps/daemon/src/index.ts is two console.log lines and a TODO to subscribe to assigned threads and relay into a local OpenClaw session. packages/channel-plugin is a README promising send, reply, and receive mapping — not an implemented adapter. PLAN.md checkboxes still look more empty than the sprint summary claims. That gap is the story, not a cover-up.

![Vercel monorepo thrash](/blog/hurley-mission-control-human-agent-comms/screenshots/vercel-thrash.png)

The secondary plot is deploy theater.

Forty-nine commits on master.
Most of those commits are deploy config thrash.
Roughly forty-one are Vercel root/bun/npm config flip-flops.

The fight ends by moving the web app to the repo root.

Also: Next 16.2.1 bump, npmrc legacy-peer-deps, HEAD b3d11ec env cleanup.

## Where

Live: https://hurley-mission-control.vercel.app (HTTP 200, title HurleyUS Mission Control).
Code: https://github.com/HurleyUS/hurley-mission-control master. HEAD b3d11ec. 49 commits. Public.
Contrast: michaelmonetized/mission-control is a Go TUI. mission-control-os is a different product. Do not merge the three names.
Dev port 3410. No fresh coding clone for this pack.

## When

2026-03-19 ET evening: 05f475c Phase 1 complete. Deploy docs same hour.
2026-03-20: Vercel monorepo storm; 8d9708e getThreads filter fix.
2026-03-21: sprint status; flatten monorepo; Next 16.2.1; HEAD b3d11ec ~10:52 PM ET.
2026-08-08: pushed_at bump, no new commit after HEAD.
2026-09-08: pack drafted; slug hurley-mission-control-human-agent-comms unused.

## Why

Agent work without a shared thread is gossip, not ops. Humans and agents as first-class users. clientMessageId so retries do not double-post. Delivery rows beat hope. Name the thrash. Cut three Mission Control names apart.

Engagement: if your agents and your humans do not share a thread id, what exactly are you operating?

const CITATION_MANAGER_COVER =
  "/blog/citation-manager-uberall-competitor-958-directories/cover.png";

const CITATION_MANAGER_CONTENT = `![Citation Manager dashboard mock — locations, submit, directories, submissions](/blog/citation-manager-uberall-competitor-958-directories/screenshots/dashboard.png)

## Who

I build operator tools for people who get paid when the NAP is right — agencies, multi-location owners, anyone tired of logging into Google, Yelp, and a dozen legacy directories by hand.

Citation Manager is for that lane. Not for academic bibliography. Not for a WNC city guide. For pushing business listings out and tracking what stuck.

If you care about local SEO plumbing, directory registries, or how a two-week SaaS sprint accumulates three auth stacks and a 500 on the homepage URL: these are the field notes.

## What

I shipped \`HurleyUS/citation-manager\` — public TypeScript repo, package **0.0.1**, **83** commits, HEAD \`78e9fb1\`.

GitHub description is blunt: manage business listings across 1000+ directories. **Uberall competitor.** The README narrows it to **958+** directories and names Uberall, BrightLocal, and Yext as the alternatives it wants to undercut on price ($99 vs $500–2000/mo copy in the roadmap).

Stack on the box: **Next.js 16.2**, React 19, **Convex**, Tailwind v4, Bun, Lucide, Puppeteer, Argon2. Clerk and \`@convex-dev/auth\` sit in \`package.json\`; Fallow marks both unused while the UI talks to \`/api/auth\` and \`localStorage\` tokens.

![Directory registry mock — rank, method, API flags from directories.json](/blog/citation-manager-uberall-competitor-958-directories/screenshots/directories.png)

The real artifact is \`data/directories.json\`: **958** rows. Rank 1 is Google Business Profile. Methods break down api 88 / form 773 / manual 70 / email 27. \`apiAvailable\` is true on 219. Convex schema mirrors that world — \`locations\`, \`directories\`, \`submissions\` with pending→submitted→verified→failed, plus \`verifications\`.

Surfaces that exist: auth, dashboard, locations CRUD, directories browser with “View All 958”, bulk submit with search/filter, submissions tracker, seed-directories API, google/yelp/facebook API routes.

What is also true:

- \`bulkSubmit\` inserts \`pending\` rows. The schedule helpers flip to \`submitted\` only if env keys exist — they do **not** call the fetch helpers in that path.
- \`generateGoogleJWT\` is a documented **placeholder**.
- Login hashes the password with Argon2 again and string-compares to the stored hash. New salt → verify cannot work as written.
- Dashboard copy still says “100+ directories” while the registry is 958.

![Bulk submit mock — location + directory multi-select](/blog/citation-manager-uberall-competitor-958-directories/screenshots/submit.png)

## Where

It is supposed to run on Vercel against Convex. Dev uses Caddy \`cm.localhost:8080\` → Next on 3000.

Probed 2026-09-08:

- **https://citation-manager-pi.vercel.app** (GitHub homepageUrl) → **500** \`MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED\`
- **https://citation-manager.vercel.app** → **200**, but it is a different “research workflow” citation app with Admin/User portals — **name collision, not this product**

Audience: local-SEO operators, agencies replacing BrightLocal/Yext spend, builders watching auth and integration honesty in a Convex/Next SaaS.

![Deploy reality mock — 500 homepage vs name-collision 200](/blog/citation-manager-uberall-competitor-958-directories/screenshots/deploy-reality.png)

## When

Created **2026-03-22**. Same day: scaffold, directory research, API skeletons, Clerk blank-page fix, Convex Auth swap, “FULL PHASE 2 READY FOR 6PM SHIP,” Google Maps submission claim, locations wired to Convex.

Late March: Argon2, push-to-directories UI, View All 958, submissions dashboard.

**2026-04-01–02:** registry expanded 100→958, Issue #12 Google/Yelp/Facebook modules, Clerk middleware returns, Phase 2B bypass + test infra, form validation, GBP PR.

**2026-05-14–15:** seven “Standardize Blacksmith CI gates” commits (same batch pattern as sibling repos) plus deploy verification fixes.

**2026-08-08:** HEAD sets \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` — same day pattern as other HurleyUS pushes.

README still says Phase 2A 100% complete and Phase 2B “current” as of early April. Stripe is still Phase 4 fiction.

![Auth whiplash timeline — Clerk → Convex Auth → Argon2 → Clerk middleware → bypass](/blog/citation-manager-uberall-competitor-958-directories/screenshots/auth-whiplash.png)

## Why

Local citations are still a grind. The expensive tools win on coverage and integrations, not on elegance. I wanted an API-first Convex backend, a ranked directory registry I own as JSON, and a submit queue I can reason about in one schema.

I also wanted to ship before the story was clean. That is why the homepage 500s, why login verify is wrong, why Clerk middleware and a bypass flag coexist, and why the integration modules look finished while bulkSubmit mostly writes \`pending\`.

The registry is real. The competitor framing is real. The production URL on the GitHub homepage is not a product yet — it is an error page.

## Engagement

If you run citations for clients: would you trust a 958-row registry with honest \`pending\` states more than a vendor dashboard that always says “submitted”? What is the minimum live integration — Google only — before this is worth putting a real domain on?

const BARBQUEWAGON_COVER =

const BARBQUEWAGON_CONTENT = `![Bar-B-Que Wagon homepage — Slow Smoked / Hand Pulled / Soul Fed over the Main Street sign](/blog/barbquewagon-bryson-city-hickory-smokehouse-site/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I build for operators. Sometimes that operator is me. Sometimes it is a pitmaster on Main Street in Bryson City, North Carolina.

Bar-B-Que Wagon needed a site that smelled like hickory — not a beige restaurant theme with a stock smoke PNG — and a catering path that did not die in a “we will call you back” void. Guests needed hours, address, phone, and a board that matched what Pat Monteith actually smokes. Planners needed guest count and event type without playing phone tag first.

I am the builder. The food is theirs. The repo is public under HurleyUS. The stack is mine to keep honest.

## What

I shipped a Next.js 16 App Router site. React 19. Bun. Tailwind 4. Biome and oxlint. Phosphor icons. Playfair Display for the smokehouse voice. DM Sans for the rest. Dark tokens: deep-smoke background, amber accents, cream type.

The homepage hero stacks three lines — Slow Smoked. Hand Pulled. Soul Fed. — over the exterior sign photo with a charcoal gradient. Nav is sticky and blurred. Logo mark on warm-white tile. Tagline Smoke • Soul • Flavor. Amber Order Now button that routes to \`/contact\` because there is no DoorDash integration pretending to be hospitality.

![Brisket plate — Yelp-sourced food photography in the repo](/blog/barbquewagon-bryson-city-hickory-smokehouse-site/screenshots/brisket-plate.jpg)

The menu is a real board in the page: smoked meat plates with two sides and cornbread, sandwiches including The Wagon Burger, sides made from scratch. Featured cards and a gallery pull Yelp food and exterior shots that landed in the repo on February 15. About is Pat’s story — twenty-plus years, 610 Main Street, no franchise fiction.

Catering is a real form: name, email, phone, event date, guest-count select, event-type select, optional message. The API validates with Zod, writes a Convex \`leads\` row when Convex is configured, and fires Resend to the owner inbox. Contact does the same twin path. Sentry on the edges. PostHog on the pageviews. Restaurant, Menu, and FoodService JSON-LD from one business-info object.

![Pork ribs plate asset](/blog/barbquewagon-bryson-city-hickory-smokehouse-site/screenshots/pork-ribs.jpg)

## Where

610 Main St. Bryson City, NC 28713. Phone 828-488-9521. Hours Tue–Sat 11–8, Sunday 11–6, closed Monday.

The URL that answers today is [barbquewagoncom.vercel.app](https://barbquewagoncom.vercel.app) — that is what GitHub lists as the homepage. Schema and copy still say \`barbquewagon.com\`. At pack time that apex has no DNS. Facebook is wired in the footer. Instagram is still a dead pound-sign href. Repo is public: [HurleyUS/barbquewagon.com](https://github.com/HurleyUS/barbquewagon.com).

The audience for *this* write-up is builders who care how a local BBQ site actually captures a wedding headcount — and anyone in the Smokies who already knows the wagon on Main.

![Exterior — building hero source](/blog/barbquewagon-bryson-city-hickory-smokehouse-site/screenshots/building-1.jpg)

## When

**2026-02-13.** Create Next App. Same night: full restaurant website. Same night again: throw out the placeholder details for real Bar-B-Que Wagon facts.

**2026-02-15.** Zod on the contact form. Yelp photos across the homepage — food gallery, menu cards, exterior. Hero background with gradient overlay.

**2026-02-21.** Lexington was wrong. Bryson City is right. That correction shipped across metadata and catering copy. Then full try/catch and Zod on both forms.

**2026-02-22.** next.config. Drop unused ThemeProvider. PLAN and CHANGELOG. Wire contact and catering to Resend. JSON-LD for Google rich results.

**2026-03-01.** TODO.md. It still lists “wire Convex/Resend” as unchecked. The commits disagree.

**2026-05-13 through 15.** Shipprep. Logo assets. Bun on Vercel. Form refactor and Fallow cleanup. Roadmap. A string of Blacksmith CI gate commits. Observability scaffolding. Deploy URL verification until Blacksmith stopped lying.

**2026-08-08.** \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` in Vercel headers. HEAD settled. Thirty-eight commits from init. That is the clock.

![Pulled pork platter](/blog/barbquewagon-bryson-city-hickory-smokehouse-site/screenshots/pulled-pork-platter.jpg)

## Why

A Main Street BBQ does not need a SaaS lander. It needs the board, the hours, the phone, and a catering form that still works when the dining room is loud.

I wanted the hero to feel like the sign on Main — not a stock smoke stock photo. I wanted leads in Convex *and* in the inbox, from Zod-validated routes, not a mailto cosplay. I wanted Schema.org to carry the same brisket and pulled pork the menu page shows. I wanted the city name to be Bryson City everywhere a crawler looks.

So I pulled the Yelp plates into the public folder, wired Resend, added JSON-LD, fixed the geography, ran the May ops gauntlet, and locked the robots header in August. Operator stack. Local business. Public repo.

The custom domain is still dark. The Vercel alias is live. The Instagram link is still a pound sign. PLAN.md still thinks the forms are unwired.

If you were standing at 610 Main tonight, which plate would you order before the kitchen sells out?

const SANTABOX_CONTENT = `![SantaBox home — Christmas 2026 campaign](/blog/santabox-charity-lootbox-rebuild/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I got tired of charity landers that look like Christmas and behave like a brochure.

Toy drives need funding progress, not stock photography. Parents need a tax receipt path. Partners need an inquiry form that emails a human — not a carousel of invented 501(c)(3) logos. Operators who inherit a wrong-vertical Next scaffold need an autopsy that says the quiet part: this README used to be BestWNC.

SantaBox is for people funding age-tagged gift boxes before December 15 delivery cutoffs, and for builders who will delete fake partner names when legal risk shows up in a commit message.

If you have ever shipped a “verified nonprofit” badge with no EIN in the repo, you are in the room.

## What

I built **SantaBox.org** — package \`santabox.org\`, version **0.1.0**, private under **HurleyUS/santabox.org**. Metadata line: *Christmas Gift Boxes for Children in Need.* Campaign badge on the live hero: **Christmas 2026 Campaign Now Open.**

Stack facts from the lockfile and tree: **Next.js 16.1.6**, **React 19.2.4**, **Tailwind 4.1**, Bun, **Convex** schema for gift boxes / donations / donors / subscribers / nonprofits / partner inquiries / impact stories, **Clerk** (optional when keys missing), **Stripe** checkout + subscribe APIs, Resend, Sentry, PostHog. Forty-two commits. HEAD \`67712cb\`.

Donate presets: $25 stocking · $50 half box · $75 small · $100 full (default) · $150 premium · $250 two boxes. Cover processing fees (\`2.9% + $0.30\`) so the gift side can stay whole. Subscribe UI/schema: **$10/mo** or **$100/yr**.

![Donate presets](/blog/santabox-charity-lootbox-rebuild/screenshots/donate.png)

## Where

Code stays private on GitHub. Product answers at **https://www.santabox.org** (apex 307→www) and the GitHub homepage URL **https://web-iota-topaz-45.vercel.app**. Both returned marketing **HTTP 200** with \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\` on pack day.

Routes that still 500 without service env: \`/impact\`, \`/subscribe\`, \`/create-wishlist\`. May 20 commits explicitly keep the public site up when service env is missing — the 500s are the other side of that bargain.

No \`public/\` directory in the tree. Layout still points at \`/og-image.png\` and favicons that are not on disk. Partners page now sells “Team Up with SantaBox” plus a grid of real team projects instead of invented orgs.

![Partners — inquiry + project grid](/blog/santabox-charity-lootbox-rebuild/screenshots/partners.png)

## When

**January 8, 2026:** \`eebf7a1\` — Next.js, Convex, Tailwind scaffold. GitHub \`created_at\` is later (Feb 6). The clock and the hosting console do not owe each other an apology; the commit log does.

**February 6:** Next 16 / React 19 / Tailwind v4 import fix.

**February 9:** Docs stop lying about BestWNC. Major rebuild commit lands the charity storytelling surface. Clerk becomes optional so builds survive missing keys. AUTOPSY.md records the crime scene: wrong layout title, empty Convex, dead buttons, wrong year, subscription-box confusion vs donation README.

**February 13:** \`10377d8\` — remove fabricated nonprofit/sponsor data. Commit body names the liability. Replacement: partner inquiry form + Resend \`/api/partner-inquiry\` + project grid of confirmed live sites.

**February 15:** Stripe webhook + signature verification + donate button actually calls checkout.

**Late February:** force-dynamic for Clerk/Convex pages, \`proxy.ts\` protection, error boundaries, sitemap/robots, security headers, auth on user mutations, \`.take(100)\` on collects.

**March:** Sentry instead of console.error spam; Vitest; then drop GitHub Actions because Vercel is CI.

**May:** Blacksmith ship gates, Santabox typecheck fixes, deploy URL verification, public-site-without-service-env.

**August 8, 2026 6:50 AM ET:** \`67712cb\` — X-Robots-Tag index, follow. HEAD. Forty-two commits.

![Boxes browse](/blog/santabox-charity-lootbox-rebuild/screenshots/boxes.png)

## Why

Because a Christmas charity site that still wears another product's metadata is worse than an unfinished one.

Because fabricated partner logos are not “placeholder content” — they are a lawsuit with good lighting.

Because dual honesty shows up here too: PLAN.md still lists Convex schema and Stripe as not started while \`convex/schema.ts\` and \`/api/checkout\` exist; AUTOPSY celebrates “production ready” with unchecked env boxes; homepage hardcodes \`statesReached: 42\` even on the live Convex path; marketing claims 501(c)(3) without an EIN file in-repo. Say the drift out loud.

Because the money path is real enough to document: fee cover math, taxReceiptSent boolean, subscriber Stripe IDs, wishlist create client, box status enum \`pending → open → funded → shipped → delivered\`.

const SHIPTHING_COVER =
  "/blog/shipthing-contacts-spine-not-carrier-rates/cover.png";

const SHIPTHING_CONTENT = `![ShipThing home — lead form + signed-in contacts table](/blog/shipthing-contacts-spine-not-carrier-rates/screenshots/home-contacts.png)

## Who

I wanted a shipping-rate desk for e-commerce sellers — compare USPS, UPS, FedEx, print labels, stop guessing retail rates.

What I built instead is for operators who need a **honest stack spine**: Clerk auth, Convex contacts, Resend lead email, Sentry, PostHog, and a Next 16 \`proxy.ts\` filename law. People who will read PLAN.md, then open the tree, and not pretend the carrier boxes are checked.

If you have ever named a repo after the product you meant to ship and then shipped the scaffolding that every later app copies — you are in the room.

## What

I built **ShipThing** — package \`shipthing\` **0.1.0**, public under **michaelmonetized/shipthing**. Layout metadata title: **Shipthing**. Description: **Combining convex, posthog, clerk and sentry**. That description is more accurate than the repo name.

Stack from the lockfile: **Next.js 16.1.1**, **React 19.2.3**, Tailwind **4**, Bun, **Clerk**, **Convex**, **Resend** + React Email, **Sentry** (org \`hustle-launch\`, project \`shipthing\`), PostHog, zod 4, react-hook-form, Radix/shadcn UI. \`stripe\` sits in dependencies with a long \`.cursor/rules/STRIPE.md\` — **zero app imports**. Thirty-nine commits. HEAD \`9f91d97\`.

![PLAN.md Not Started vs what the tree actually contains](/blog/shipthing-contacts-spine-not-carrier-rates/screenshots/plan-vs-shipped.png)

Surfaces that exist: \`/\` lead form (“Be the first to contact us!” / Send Message with name, 10-digit phone, email, message) plus signed-in **Contacts** table with delete; \`/login\`; \`/sentry-example-page\`; API routes \`/api/send/notification\` and \`/api/send/confirmation\`; \`proxy.ts\` Clerk middleware file; \`sitemap.ts\` / \`robots.ts\`.

Convex schema is a single \`contacts\` table — search index on name, indexes by name/phone/email/page. Notification mail sends from \`Notifications <notify@uncap.us>\` to \`michaelmonetized@gmail.com\` and \`8285931935@vtext.com\`. Confirmation is a short “Hey {name}, we received your message” React Email.

Navbar lists Security, Auth, Layout, Typography, Forms, Analytics, Error Tracking, Email, Realtime Data Sync, APIs, More — **no \`/features/*\` pages** in the tree. Footer still links Learn / Examples / nextjs.org from create-next-app.

\`PLAN.md\` still sells the other product: carrier APIs, rate comparison, ZPL/PDF labels, address validation, Shopify import, batch labels, tracking, cost analytics. Success metrics: active users > 500, monthly labels > 10,000, savings > 30%. Every checkbox is empty.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/shipthing](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/shipthing) — **public**. Live: [shipthing.vercel.app](https://shipthing.vercel.app) (**HTTP 200**, Clerk signed-out chrome, \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`).

![proxy.ts + check:proxy Next 16 guardrail](/blog/shipthing-contacts-spine-not-carrier-rates/screenshots/proxy-guardrail.png)

Audience sits next to every “I’ll bolt carriers on next sprint” SaaS skeleton. Sibling operator furniture: Fallow gate notes in \`AGENTS.md\`, Bun-only local law, Blacksmith/Vercel prebuilt rules, env.template for Clerk + Resend + Convex.

![Resend notification + confirmation lead path](/blog/shipthing-contacts-spine-not-carrier-rates/screenshots/resend-lead-path.png)

## When

**2025-03-22** — Create Next App. Same day: Convex + PostHog + Sentry, not-found + shadcn button, middleware build thrash, Clerk, forms.

**2025-03-26–27** — Convex contacts land. Resend starts. Real bugs: could not access \`name\` in notification email, copy-pasta, split emails so sending stops after the first try/catch, more Resend fixes, light-mode toggle attempt.

**2025-03-28–29** — Navbar, error boundary, login. Then: \`convex dev, i finally recovered my github login 🎉\`.

**2025-04** — layout components; **box, stack, deck** + Next update.

**2025-12-29** — React Server Components CVE pass.

**2026-01-08** — \`PLAN.md\` with shipping-rate “improvement opportunities.” Jan 31 chore sync.

**2026-02** — CVE PR #1; rename \`middleware.ts\` → \`proxy.ts\` (#7); env.template (#8); proxy filename guardrail (#10); security headers (#11); sitemap + robots (#12).

**2026-06-22** — nightly ×2.

**2026-08-08** — HEAD \`9f91d97\`: set \`X-Robots-Tag\` to \`index, follow\` on Vercel.

![Commit arc Mar 2025 → Aug 2026](/blog/shipthing-contacts-spine-not-carrier-rates/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because the shipping product needed a spine before it needed a carrier SDK — and the spine is what survived.

Because Next 16 renamed the middleware file and I wanted a script that fails if \`middleware.ts\` comes back (\`bun run check:proxy\`).

Because a lead form that emails me and texts \`8285931935@vtext.com\` is a product loop I can prove. A FedEx rate matrix I never integrated is not.

Because naming the repo ShipThing and leaving PLAN.md full of unchecked USPS boxes is more useful as an operator story than as a fake launch post.

**Engagement Q:** When your PLAN.md still lists the vertical and your \`layout.tsx\` description lists the stack — which one should the blog title obey?

const CONVEX_NEXTFASTER_CONTENT = `![Convex NextFaster home mock](/blog/convex-nextfaster-perf-meets-convex-ecommerce-scaffold/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I got tired of cloning e-commerce starters that worship Postgres or pretend performance is a CSS animation.

NextFaster proved PPR, prefetch, mouseDown nav, React Compiler, inline CSS. I wanted that DNA on Convex with Clerk, Stripe, Resend, Sentry, PostHog.

For operators who ship schema before fake catalog. If you clicked Shop Now on your own template and hit a 404, you are in the room.

## What

I built Convex NextFaster — package convex-nextfaster v1.0.0, public HurleyUS/convex-nextfaster. fork=false; 355 upstream + 5 mine.

Stack: Next.js 15.3.0, React 19, PPR + inlineCss + reactCompiler, Convex (1115 LOC), Clerk, Stripe, Sentry, PostHog, Resend.

## Where

https://github.com/HurleyUS/convex-nextfaster — public. No homepage. No demo.

## When

2026-01-08 a18c09c cutover; c635ab3 drop data.zip; e1164e9 PLAN.
2026-01-31 db28fe7 sync.
2026-08-08 125dd75 X-Robots-Tag. HEAD. 360 commits; 5 mine.

## Why

Perf demos that force SQL as destiny are a tax. A Convex cart with expiry beats Lighthouse of a deleted tree. Shipping 1.0.0 with PLAN Not Started is honesty.

Who else stars templates that document routes they never created?

const MISSION_CONTROL_TUI_COVER =
  "/blog/mission-control-go-tui-p10k-portfolio-ops/cover.png";

const MISSION_CONTROL_TUI_CONTENT = `![p10k-style TUI zones — status, search, project list, chat, totals](/blog/mission-control-go-tui-p10k-portfolio-ops/screenshots/tui-p10k-layout.png)

## Who

I keep too many projects hot at once. Vercel rows. Swift builds. git dirt. GitHub issues and PRs. Browser tabs do not scale.

Hurley Mission Control is a different product — humans and agents on one Convex thread model with deliveries. mission-control-os is another name. This pack is the local operator strip: a p10k-inspired Go TUI named Mission Control under michaelmonetized.

If you want one \`mc\` binary, a Nerd Font, and a scrollable portfolio instead of five CLIs in five tabs — you are in the room.

## What

I built **Mission Control** — public **michaelmonetized/mission-control**. README: a p10k-inspired TUI for managing all your projects. Phase 1 complete badge. 18 tests. Go.

Shipped local stack: **Go 1.25.4**, Charm **Bubble Tea** + Lipgloss, \`cmd/mc\` → \`mc\`, discovery + \`~/.hustlemc/\` cache, OpenClaw client foundation. Shell suite under \`bin/\`: discover, git/gh/vercel/swift status, stats, cache, dev, caddy, chat, deploy, and more — with \`--json\`.

![Shell suite mc-* with --json](/blog/mission-control-go-tui-p10k-portfolio-ops/screenshots/shell-suite-json.png)

Phase 2 scaffold: \`apps/web\` \`@mission-control/web@2.0.0\` — Next **16.1.0**, React 19, Clerk, Convex on port **3410**. Schema: users (GitHub + BYO Claude key + Stripe customer + free minutes), repos, workspaces (Fly VM lifecycle), usageRecords, threads/messages (**sender user|openclaw**), webhookEvents. \`services/vm-manager\` Go service for Fly Machines, terminal WebSocket relay, $0.02/min, idle kill.

![Phase 2 cloud — repos workspaces usage Fly VMs](/blog/mission-control-go-tui-p10k-portfolio-ops/screenshots/phase2-cloud-vm.png)

Not the HurleyUS human|agent deliveries plane. PLAN.md still mentions Ink/React — the entrypoint is Bubble Tea. March 21 “Phases 3–7 Complete” is mostly docs + scaffold burst. No dedicated public homepage on this repo; \`vercel.json\` only sets robots index,follow. HEAD **fd25166**. **22** commits.

![Three Mission Control names cut apart](/blog/mission-control-go-tui-p10k-portfolio-ops/screenshots/name-cut.png)

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/mission-control](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/mission-control) — **public** — **main**.
Contrast: [hurley-mission-control.vercel.app](https://hurley-mission-control.vercel.app) is the other product.
Install: \`go build -o mc-tui ./cmd/mc\` · symlink \`~/.local/bin/mc\`. Config: \`~/.hustlemc/\`.

## When

**2026-02-16** — initial TUI, tests, Phase 2 plan, OpenClaw foundation.
**2026-02-21** — TUI redesign matching original spec (#2).
**2026-02-27–28** — CI gate; Vercel-only; drop GH Actions config.
**2026-03-20** — LOCATIONS.md; relay/webhook/daemon/E2E.
**2026-03-21** — Phases 3–7 claim + Phase 2 Convex/docs/go-live stack.
**2026-08-08** — HEAD fd25166 robots tag.
**2026-09-08** — draft pack; slug unused.

## Why

One keyboard surface for deploy + git + issues beats gossip across tabs. \`--json\` scripts keep the TUI accountable. Phase 2’s bet is BYO Claude + metered VMs. Say the three Mission Control names so they stay separate.

Engagement: if deploy state and git dirt only live in browser tabs — what are you actually controlling?

const GLASS_DESIGN_SYSTEM_COVER =
  "/blog/glass-design-system-apple-svg-refraction-showcase/cover.png";

const GLASS_DESIGN_SYSTEM_CONTENT = `![Glass Design System home — video hero and glass contact form](/blog/glass-design-system-apple-svg-refraction-showcase/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I needed liquid glass on the web that bent the photograph behind it — not a CSS blur wearing a trench coat, and not a WebGL sphere I install from a registry.

That operator is me on a March afternoon with a BRIEF.md that names five effects and hard rules: real Catppuccin \`dark:\` classes, no \`filter: invert()\`, Tailwind v4 only, Next 16.

It is also anyone comparing two glass paths in my queue. twelveux ships pen.dev **glass.glsl** as a hosted shadcn item. This repo is the other path: SVG \`feDisplacementMap\`, animated conic borders, jelly nav, Apple-style sidebar — a full demo site over HustleLaunch photo and video plates.

Frontend builders who live in shadcn New York primitives but want the chrome to refract. Catppuccin people who refuse grayscale hacks. MarTech / indie product people who need cards, forms, dialogs, and a contact sidebar that still read when the backdrop is a real campaign still.

## What

I built **glass-design-system** — Next.js 16.2.6, React 19.2.6, Tailwind 4.3, shadcn New York, package \`0.1.0\` private. Bun lockfile. Live title: Glass Design System.

Five effects from the project brief, all in the tree:

1. **Apple Liquid Glass** — \`GlassPanel\` + \`src/lib/displacement.ts\`. SVG displacement map, chromatic aberration, strength/depth/radius props, \`backdropFilter: url(...)\`.
2. **AnimatedBorder** — \`@property --conic-gradient-angle\`, mask compositing, optional glow. Pink→Blue Catppuccin conic.
3. **Glass morphism** — layered \`color-mix\` gradients + blur. Opacity got walked down hard so the displacement stays visible.
4. **GlassNav** — framer-motion jelly indicator that follows the active route.
5. **Catppuccin Mocha / Latte** — real tokens in \`globals.css\`. Geist on the page (Max stays on twelveux / uncap / hms).

Glass barrel at \`src/components/glass/\`: panel, border, card, nav, button, dialog, sheet, sidebar (+ provider), form controls, \`use-glass-surface\`.

Routes:

- \`/\` — video hero, YouTube embed, glass contact form in AnimatedBorder, value copy, CTA.
- \`/components\` — ~3,215 lines. Commit message says 80+ example variations across commerce, auth, analytics, productivity, messaging, and states.
- \`/about\` — content page using the system.

Layout shell: sticky GlassNav + non-modal right **GlassSidebar** titled Quick Contact.

Backgrounds under \`public/bg/\` — hero-video.webm, hero-michael.jpg, campaign-monitoring.webp, web-designer.png, and the rest of the HustleLaunch stills. March 21 replaced flat gradient section shells with full-width photographic plates so the glass has something to bend.

Reference originals stay in-tree (\`reference-apple-glass/\`, \`reference-animated-border.css\`). Fallow marks them unused. That is honest — they are the port sources, not runtime.

Fallow REVIEW snapshot: ~10,194 LOC, dead files 11.1%, dead exports 24.9%, one circular dep. GlassSheet / GlassButton / GlassSidebar sit in the high-CRAP table. Live response sends \`X-Robots-Tag: index, follow\`.

![Components showcase — glass cards over photographic backdrop](/blog/glass-design-system-apple-svg-refraction-showcase/screenshots/components-loaded.png)

## Where

Live: https://glass-design-system.vercel.app

Repo: https://github.com/michaelmonetized/glass-design-system

Homepage field on GitHub points at that Vercel app. Adjacent systems in the same operator map: twelveux (WebGL registry Glass), modern-design-playground (WebGL instrument + nine worlds), uncap.us and hms (Max + Catppuccin product surfaces — different jobs).

## When

**2026-03-05, 1:41 PM ET.** Brief + reference files.

**2:12.** Core feat: apple glass refraction, animated borders, jelly nav, Catppuccin.

**2:30–3:14.** Photo/video sections, HustleLaunch assets, local webm instead of a dead WordPress URL, fixed parallax plates.

**3:23–3:53.** Opacity and contrast wars — glass-morphism thin enough for displacement, Tailwind utility backgrounds overridden, nav readable, gradient repeat tuned, button/dialog/sheet contrast fixed.

**4:01–4:31.** Apple-style non-modal glass sidebar, glass form components, hero wireframe iterations until video left + form right matched the layout.

Sixteen commits the same afternoon.

**2026-03-21, 7:25–9:35 AM ET.** Comprehensive showcase (80+), mobile 375px stacking, animated gradients then real \`/public/bg/\` assets, full-width absolute section shells.

**2026-06-22.** Two \`nightly\` commits.

**2026-08-08, 6:49 AM ET.** HEAD \`0814e1f\` — X-Robots-Tag index, follow. Same robots batch as several sibling Vercel repos that morning. **24** commits on main.

## Why

I already had Apple-glass and animated-border references sitting as ports. I wanted them inside Next 16 / Tailwind 4 / shadcn with Catppuccin that does not cheat.

Glass only proves itself against a photograph or a video plate. Gradients flatter. The March 21 backdrop swap is the reason the showcase exists at that density.

twelveux answers a different question — can I \`npx\` Max, theme, and a real WebGL Glass shader. This repo answers: can the whole chrome stack refract with SVG displacement and still ship a contact sidebar and an 80-variation gallery.

## Engagement

If you already run twelveux Glass, what breaks first when you try SVG displacement over a busy campaign still instead — chromatic fringe, text contrast, or the nav jelly fighting the sidebar?

const ITOUR_GOLF_COVER =
  "/blog/itour-golf-tour-lander-ahead-of-deploy/cover.png";

const ITOUR_GOLF_CONTENT = `![iTour.golf HEAD homepage mock — May 12 2027 inaugural, Join iLeague to Qualify](/blog/itour-golf-tour-lander-ahead-of-deploy/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I build ecosystem products that have to stay distinct under one brand family. Golf creators already get a scorecard-and-tips platform on [iLeague.golf](https://ileague.golf). That pack is a different story — Patreon meets 18Birdies, Stripe tiers, fifteen percent fee.

iTour.golf is for the next layer: creators who need a **season** to aim at, courses that want to **host** a stop, and sponsors who buy **tour inventory** instead of a creator subscription.

If you care about monorepo landers that outrun their Vercel deploy, Convex schemas that model tournaments before any admin UI exists, or how not to collapse three golf domains into one blog post: this is the field notes.

## What

I shipped a national golf **creator tour** under \`HurleyUS/itour.golf\`.

README one-liner: iPro.golf’s national influencer golf tour. Brain note (\`iLeague Golf.md\`): **36-week** tour; **top 54** qualify for iConference. HEAD lander badge: **The National Golf Influencer Tour**. H1: **iTour.golf**. Line: **Where Golf Creators Become Champions**.

Stack on the box: **Next.js 15.5.6**, **React 19**, Convex, Clerk (optional when the publishable key is missing), PostHog, Sentry, Resend, Tailwind v4, Bun workspaces (\`web\` + \`mobile\`), Inter + Oswald, Vercel. Package **itour-monorepo** **1.0.0**. Repo private. Site public at [www.itour.golf](https://www.itour.golf) (apex 307s to www).

![Championship path mock — iLeague → iTour → iConference](/blog/itour-golf-tour-lander-ahead-of-deploy/screenshots/championship-path.png)

This is **not** the creator billing product. There is **no Stripe dependency** in \`web/package.json\`. README monetization is blunt:

1. Sponsors, ads, vendors, partners, investors  
2. Courses bid to host stops on the iTour  

HEAD page CTAs: **Join iLeague to Qualify** (outbound to ileague.golf) and **Become a Sponsor** / **Host a Tour Stop** (on-page sections with buttons — not checkout).

Convex \`web/convex/schema.ts\` is tour-shaped: \`users\` (creator|fan|admin), \`courses\` (optional week), \`tournaments\` (weeks 1–36), \`entries\` (score + videoUrl), \`standings\`. No \`subscriptionTiers\`. No \`tips\`. No content feed. Those tables live on the iLeague sibling.

What is also true on pack day:

- **Live www** still markets **“2026 Season Now Open”**, **18 Stops / 18 Courses / 1 Champion**, a fake **Desert Classic** at Pebble Beach, a fake leaderboard, and a **$3.5M+** prize-pool story aimed at a Sept 9 **2026** Augusta finale.  
- **Repo HEAD** \`page.tsx\` is the amber rewrite: **36-week** season, **May 12, 2027** inaugural, **Top 54 → iConference**, qualify-via-iLeague funnel.  
- \`layout.tsx\` SEO says **36 weeks, 36 courses**; the hero says **18 courses of their choice**. PLAN/OPPORTUNITIES still say top **18**. Brain + footer say top **54**.  
- CHANGELOG 1.0.0 still claims “golf course discovery and booking.” sitrep.md still says **PROTOTYPE** with last commit stamped **2026-01-31**.  
- Mobile is an Expo stub that renders the words **Mobile App**.  

That gap is the product story — not a footnote.

![Live vs HEAD deploy drift mock](/blog/itour-golf-tour-lander-ahead-of-deploy/screenshots/live-vs-head.png)

## Where

It is supposed to run on Vercel against Convex with Clerk when keys exist. Providers deliberately render without Clerk if \`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\` is unset (May 14 fix). Convex client only instantiates when \`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL\` is set.

Surfaces that matter on HEAD:

- Public amber lander — hero, how-to-qualify (4 steps), championship path, 2027 coming-soon chips, host-a-stop, sponsors, ecosystem footer  
- \`robots.ts\` / \`sitemap.ts\` / JSON-LD SportsOrganization + SportsEvent (2027-05-12 → 2027-09-09)  
- Middleware protect list for dashboard/account/settings/api — public marketing routes stay public  
- Mobile folder — scaffold only  

Live HTML on 2026-09-08 did **not** show Clerk \`pk_test\` / \`pk_live\` strings. The stale marketing shell is prerendered on Vercel (\`x-nextjs-prerender: 1\`).

Related domains in the footer/copy: **iLeague.golf** (emerald — creator platform), **iTour.golf** (amber — this pack), **iConference.golf** (purple — championship). Do not collapse this post into the iLeague creator-economy pack.

## When

**January 8, 2026.** Initial Next.js + Convex + Tailwind setup. OPPORTUNITIES and homepage docs the same day. This tree starts as a tour concept, not a WNC directory.

**January 31.** Chore sync. sitrep still thinks this is the last meaningful stamp — it is wrong.

**February 11.** GitHub \`HurleyUS/itour.golf\` exists. Homepage gets ecosystem context. iTour/iCon details corrected from the OG vision. Placeholder season data removed — **TBD until May 12, 2027**.

**February 15.** Explicit commit: **replace bestwnc.com boilerplate with iTour content**. Lineage matters so this pack does not retell BestWNC.

**February 21.** Fonts, favicon, Tailwind v4 CSS-first, React 19 types, providers/middleware/schema/layout batch, CHANGELOG labeled 1.0.0.

**Late February.** CI build gate, security headers + regression script, SEO/analytics baseline, then GitHub Actions removed because Vercel is CI.

**March 28.** Workspace scripts stop using bun filters — \`cd web && bun run …\`. A Gumroad \`/pricing\` page also appears in history (Golfer Basic/Pro pre-order links) — not the live shell’s center of gravity.

**May 14–15.** Blacksmith CI standardize noise, then delete it. **Skip Clerk provider when key is unavailable** — lander must not hard-crash without auth config.

**June 22.** Two \`nightly\` commits. HEAD **\`d2a49ef\`**. Last push on the repo.

**September 8, 2026 (pack day).** www returns 200. Content is still the old 18-Stops / fake-season shell. Draft pack only — no publish, no push.

![Convex tour schema mock — users courses tournaments entries standings](/blog/itour-golf-tour-lander-ahead-of-deploy/screenshots/tour-schema.png)

## Why

Because the HurleyUS golf stack needs **three honest products**, not one blog post with three domains.

iLeague is where creators publish, subscribe, and tip. iTour is where a **season** and **sponsor/host** economy are supposed to live. iConference is the September championship punchline. If you describe iTour as “another creator SaaS,” you erase the only reason the domain exists.

Because **schema-before-UI** is an operator move: tournaments 1–36, entries with video URLs, season standings — committed while the live site still invents Jake Matthews and a Desert Classic.

Because **deploy drift** is a better lesson than a launch party. Rewriting \`page.tsx\` for May 2027 does nothing for golf fans if Vercel keeps serving the 2026 placeholder season. Same pattern as shipping robots \`index,follow\` while leaving test keys on a sibling domain — different failure mode, same honesty requirement.

Because the money model is different on purpose. No platform fee constant. No tip presets. Sponsor tiers and course hosting bids are the README — even if the buttons still go nowhere.

## Engagement

If you run a marketing lander in a monorepo: what do you trust on pack day — \`git show HEAD:app/page.tsx\`, or \`curl\` the production HTML — and which one did you ship last?

const ASCII_COMMIT_GRAPH_CONTENT = `![Terminal heatmap](/blog/ascii-commit-graph-terminal-heatmap-cd-hook-fastpath/screenshots/terminal-heatmap.png)

## Who

I wanted GitHub's contribution calendar without leaving the shell — and on every \`cd\` via zoxide, not only when I opened a browser tab.

For operators who hang visual git context off directory changes, and who will delete an alias the moment it gets slow.

## What

I built **ascii-commit-graph** — public \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/ascii-commit-graph\`. README **V1.0.4**. Script \`ascii-commit-graph.sh\`, 209 lines. HEAD \`9221b76\`. 13 commits. 1 star. CLI only.

Paints a GitHub-style week grid (Nerd Font glyph, ANSI greens). \`GRID_ROWS=6\`, \`GRID_COLS=51\` sliding weeks. Buckets 0/1/2/3+.

Flags: \`--this-year\`, \`--full-width\`, \`--author\`, \`--show-issues\`, \`--show-todos\`.

![Flags](/blog/ascii-commit-graph-terminal-heatmap-cd-hook-fastpath/screenshots/flags-panel.png)

v1.0.4 local path: one \`git log\` pass, O(1) bumps, GNU+BSD dates. \`--author\`: one \`gh\` GraphQL contributionCalendar call. Extras opt-in so default/cd path stays lean.

![Fast path](/blog/ascii-commit-graph-terminal-heatmap-cd-hook-fastpath/screenshots/fastpath-rewrite.png)

README zoxide \`zcd\` runs \`--full-width --show-issues --show-todos\` on every cd — that habit forced the Jul 2026 rewrite. ROADMAP still unchecked: Create a release for 1.0.4. Install snippet still references \`michael-k/\`.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/ascii-commit-graph](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/ascii-commit-graph) — public. No live web app. Clone + chmod + symlink.

![zoxide hook](/blog/ascii-commit-graph-terminal-heatmap-cd-hook-fastpath/screenshots/zoxide-cd-hook.png)

## When

**2024-06-06** — rc + docs + PNGs + PR #1.
**2024-06-08** — customization; v1.0.3-rc prep.
**2026-06-03** — compatibility.
**2026-07-31** — HEAD \`9221b76\`: Speed up heatmap: single git pass and one GraphQL author fetch.

![Commit arc](/blog/ascii-commit-graph-terminal-heatmap-cd-hook-fastpath/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because browser greens are a context switch. Because a cd-hook heatmap makes latency a product bug. Because one git pass + one GraphQL call is the honest fix — and an unchecked release checkbox beats a fake tag.

**Engagement Q:** If your cd alias paints a heatmap, what latency makes you delete the alias?

const NIRI_MACOS_CONTENT = `![niri-macos scrollable column strip concept](/blog/niri-macos-scrollable-tiling-swift-ax-port/screenshots/scroll-strip-concept.png)

## Who

I wanted niri's scrollable tiling on the Mac without living inside Hammerspoon.

YaLTeR's [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) is a Wayland compositor: windows live in columns on an **infinite horizontal strip**; you scroll the strip like a document; opening a window does not crush the ones you already have. PaperWM.spoon already brings that idea to macOS — in Lua, on Hammerspoon. I wanted the same paradigm as a **native Swift daemon** with Accessibility APIs, spring animations, and a yabai-shaped IPC CLI so skhd can drive it.

If you have ever rewritten a compositor concept as a weekend Accessibility prototype and then left an autopsy in the repo for future-you — this is that diary.

## What

I built **niri-macos** — SPM package \`niri-macos\`, version **0.1.0** (\`niri-macos --version\`), public under **michaelmonetized/niri-macos**. Platforms: **macOS 13+**. Zero external Swift packages. Products: library **NiriCore**, daemon **niri-macos**, CLI **niri-msg**.

Stack from the tree: AppKit + CoreGraphics + QuartzCore, \`AXObserver\` / \`AXUIElement\` for event-driven window tracking, \`CGWindowList\` enumeration, \`CVDisplayLink\` 60fps spring animation, \`CGEventTap\` gestures, Unix socket IPC at \`/tmp/niri-macos.sock\` with JSON commands. Config is JSON via \`ConfigManager\` at \`~/.config/niri-macos/config.json\` (gaps, outer gaps, preset widths, spring params, scroll thresholds, windowRules Codable). Hotkeys stay external — **skhd** bindings documented in README and \`HOTKEYS.md\`. Gestures: **Cmd+Shift+scroll** (focus window), **Cmd+scroll** (workspace), **3-finger swipe** (free scroll with momentum).

![Architecture — NiriCore, daemon, niri-msg, skhd](/blog/niri-macos-scrollable-tiling-swift-ax-port/screenshots/architecture-ipc.png)

Surfaces that exist: horizontal layout engine (\`LayoutEngine.swift\` ~44KB), consume/expel column stacking, center/maximize/preset widths (33/50/66/100%), dynamic workspaces (up/down/create above/below), split groups (horizontal/vertical/quad), multi-monitor isolation (active monitor follows mouse), menubar operations, \`niri-msg status\` / \`list-windows\` / \`quit\`. Tests: **112** \`func test*\` under \`NiriCoreTests\` (layout, types, IPC). CI: GitHub Actions on \`macos-14\` — build, test, release build. HEAD \`d21a739\`. **Four** commits. ~226KB of Swift.

README still marks Planned: focus ring overlay, window-rule **enforcement** (structs parse; sitrep says not applied), overview mode, sketchybar integration, Homebrew formula, launchd plist. PLAN.md still dreams of KDL like upstream niri — the shipped parser is JSON.

![AUTOPSY.md roast vs sitrep FUNCTIONAL](/blog/niri-macos-scrollable-tiling-swift-ax-port/screenshots/autopsy-vs-sitrep.png)

\`AUTOPSY.md\` (dated 2026-02-09) is the scar: it calls the early tree a 3,672-line prototype with **two** commits, **zero** tests, seven singletons, hardcoded gaps, and a README that was “aspirational fiction.” It also credits real spring physics, a thoughtful IPC command set, and clean \`ColumnWidth\` modeling. \`sitrep.md\` at the same era (updated for the refactor) says **FUNCTIONAL** — 112 passing tests, JSON config, protocol-based DI, main-thread layout serialization. The June 22 \`nightly\` commits are where that contradiction resolves in git history.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/niri-macos](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/niri-macos) — **public**. No hosted demo. Run locally: \`swift build -c release\`, put \`niri-macos\` on your PATH, grant **Accessibility**, start the daemon, drive it with \`niri-msg\` / skhd. Socket default \`/tmp/niri-macos.sock\`. Log default \`/tmp/niri-macos.log\`.

## When

- **2026-02-06** — \`640d314\` feat: implement niri scrolling layout paradigm for macOS (initial README/PLAN + core sources).
- **2026-02-08** — \`37f34ad\` “fix” that is really a sequel: multi-monitor isolation, discrete scroll, workspace creation, split groups, animation/gestures/AX observer (+2391/−132). AUTOPSY calls the message an undersell.
- **2026-02-09** — AUTOPSY.md examination date; sitrep claims FUNCTIONAL + 112 tests (landed in tree with the later nightly push).
- **2026-06-22** — GitHub repo \`created_at\`; two \`nightly\` commits (\`f3b1d77\`, HEAD \`d21a739\`) ship NiriCore extraction, ConfigManager, full test suite, workflow, AUTOPSY in-tree, hustlemc/uncap crumbs. Last push \`2026-06-22T22:20:39Z\`.

![Four-commit arc](/blog/niri-macos-scrollable-tiling-swift-ax-port/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because I use macOS and I still want niri's rule: **new windows append; existing frames stay**; scroll the strip; isolate per monitor. Hammerspoon is fine. I wanted direct APIs, spring physics I own, and \`niri-msg\` that feels like talking to yabai while the layout model is niri's.

I also wanted the honesty layer. Shipping AUTOPSY.md next to a polished README is the point: document the Jenga tower, then answer it with tests and a library boundary instead of deleting the roast.

## Engagement Q

Would you rather run scrollable tiling as **native Swift + Accessibility + skhd**, or stay on **PaperWM.spoon** and keep the Lua runtime — and what would make you trust a 0.1.0 WM with four commits and 112 tests?

const CODEFOLIO_COVER =
  "/blog/codefolio-spec-first-github-portfolio-saas/cover.png";

const CODEFOLIO_CONTENT = `![Codefolio marketing hero — Public Beta + Get started free](/blog/codefolio-spec-first-github-portfolio-saas/screenshots/marketing-hero.png)

## Who

I wanted a **developer portfolio platform** — not another personal homepage. Multi-tenant. GitHub sync. Pin six projects on free. Custom domain on Pro. Analytics that tell you whether recruiters came from Twitter or a blog referral.

Who this is for: operators who will read \`DESIGN.md\` and \`CONTRACTS.md\` before they trust a launch tweet, and people who have watched a SaaS invent “10K+ developers” before the Vercel project exists.

If you have ever claimed a \`.dev\` domain in \`openGraph.url\` and then discovered the hostname already belongs to someone else's portfolio — stay in the room.

## What

I built **Codefolio** — package \`codefolio\` **0.1.0**, **private** under **michaelmonetized/codefolio**. Layout title: **Codefolio - Developer Portfolio Platform**. Description: **Showcase your code. Build your reputation. The modern portfolio platform for developers.**

Stack from package.json: **Next.js 16.2.6**, **React 19.2.6**, Tailwind **4.3**, Bun, **Clerk** (\`@clerk/nextjs\` ^7.3.3), **Convex** ^1.38.0, \`stripe\` + \`@stripe/stripe-js\`, \`resend\`, \`posthog-js\`, \`@sentry/nextjs\`, radix-ui, next-themes (dark default). Three commits. HEAD \`c499a72\`.

![Free / Pro $9 / Team $29 pricing grid](/blog/codefolio-spec-first-github-portfolio-saas/screenshots/pricing-tiers.png)

Surfaces that exist in the tree:

- Marketing: \`/\`, \`/features\`, \`/pricing\`, \`/about\`, \`/blog\`, \`/careers\`, \`/examples\`, \`/privacy\`, \`/terms\`, \`/login\`, \`/signup\`
- Public portfolio: \`/:username\`, \`/:username/:project\`, \`/:username/resume\`
- Dashboard (Clerk-protected via \`proxy.ts\`): \`/dashboard\`, \`/dashboard/projects\`, \`/dashboard/projects/[id]\`, \`/dashboard/analytics\`, \`/dashboard/settings\`

Convex schema is five tables — \`profiles\`, \`projects\`, \`analytics\`, \`subscriptions\`, \`githubSyncs\`. GitHub sync action pulls \`api.github.com/users/{username}/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated&type=owner\` and upserts. Plan limits in \`lib/types.ts\`: Free 6 pins / 7-day analytics; Pro unlimited + custom domain + 90 days + case studies + remove branding; Team 5 members + 365-day analytics.

Pricing cards match: **Free**, **Pro $9/mo**, **Team $29/mo**.

What does **not** exist: \`app/api/**\` (no Stripe webhook route handlers), a \`/demo\` page (Hero still links there), a live deploy on the probed Vercel hostnames, or ownership of **codefolio.dev**.

Docs are not an afterthought. \`DESIGN.md\` (~1083 lines), \`CONTRACTS.md\` (~466), \`COMPLIANCE.md\` (~1171 WCAG 2.1 AA), \`TECH-REQ.md\` (~429), plus Fallow \`REVIEW.md\` (~9.2k LOC, 6 unused deps including stripe/resend/posthog, dashboard pages marked critical complexity).

Hero badge: **Now in Public Beta**. Social proof strip: **10K+ Developers / 50K+ Projects Showcased / 1M+ Portfolio Views**. Those numbers are marketing copy with no telemetry backing in the private tree.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/codefolio](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/codefolio) — **private**. Live app URL: **none** at pack time (\`codefolio.vercel.app\` → 404).

![Five Convex tables vs Stripe/Resend unused deps](/blog/codefolio-spec-first-github-portfolio-saas/screenshots/schema-five-tables.png)

Layout \`openGraph.url\` and feature copy talk about **codefolio.dev**. Probe on 2026-09-08: \`https://www.codefolio.dev\` returns **HTTP 200** for **Abdel Ahzab, Full-Stack Engineer shipping Applied AI** — unrelated personal site on Cloudflare/Vercel. That is a **name collision**, not my deploy.

![codefolio.dev claimed in OG vs live third-party portfolio](/blog/codefolio-spec-first-github-portfolio-saas/screenshots/domain-collision.png)

Audience sits next to every “portfolio SaaS” that ships specs + dashboard chrome before billing webhooks and a domain you actually control.

## When

**2026-02-07** — \`531f712\` Create Next App. Bootstrap wrap-up in \`.work/\` claims Convex project \`codefolio\`, schema complete (5 tables / 16 indexes), CONTRACTS.md, shadcn button/card/input, build passes.

**2026-06-22 ~5:44 PM ET** — \`01aa6cc\` **nightly**. The product and the essay-length docs land together: marketing, dashboard, public portfolio/resume, Fallow gate hooks, DESIGN/COMPLIANCE/TECH-REQ/REVIEW.

**2026-06-22 ~6:19 PM ET** — \`c499a72\` **nightly** HEAD.

GitHub \`created_at\` / \`pushed_at\` both sit on **2026-06-22** even though the first commit is February — private repo timing vs local history.

![Three-commit arc Feb → June nightlies](/blog/codefolio-spec-first-github-portfolio-saas/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because a portfolio platform is a different product from a personal site, and I wanted the contracts written before the launch thread.

Because Clerk + Convex + a real \`/:username\` surface is useful even when Stripe checkout is still schema fiction.

Because claiming \`codefolio.dev\` in metadata while the hostname serves another engineer is the kind of fact you put in the brief **before** you buy ads.

Because three commits can still carry nine thousand lines — and Fallow will still tell you stripe and resend never got imported.

**Engagement Q:** When your OG URL names a \`.dev\` you do not control and your Hero invents 10K users — do you fix the domain story first, or the fake social proof?

const STRIPE_CONVEX_COVER =

const STRIPE_CONVEX_CONTENT = `![stripe-convex API surface — Pay, Cart, Checkout, Has, Convex exports](/blog/stripe-convex-email-payments-theo-unpublished/screenshots/api-surface.png)

## Who

I wanted one payment module I could drop into getat.me, hustlelaunch, and every other Convex SaaS instead of rewriting Stripe checkout + webhooks per repo.

Who it is for now: operators who bill by **email** before they finish auth binding; builders who want Convex \`sc_*\` tables and idempotent webhook logs without starting from Theo KV snippets; anyone who will check the registry before they trust a README badge.

## What

I built **stripe-convex** — public under **michaelmonetized/stripe-convex**, package **0.1.0**, MIT on paper. Peer deps: Convex ≥1, Stripe ≥14, React ≥18. Built with tsup + Bun. Exports: root types/components, \`stripe-convex/convex\`, \`stripe-convex/components\`.

React surface: \`StripeConvexProvider\`, \`Pay\`, compound \`AddToCart\` (with \`CartItemPlan\`), \`Cart\`, \`Checkout\`, \`Has\`. Hooks: \`useStripeConvex\`, \`useCart\`, \`useCoupon\`, \`useCheckout\`, \`useHasAccess\`.

![sc_* Convex schema tables](/blog/stripe-convex-email-payments-theo-unpublished/screenshots/schema-sc-tables.png)

Convex schema spreads six tables: \`sc_customers\`, \`sc_payments\`, \`sc_subscriptions\`, \`sc_orders\`, \`sc_coupon_usage\`, \`sc_webhook_events\`. Customers are indexed by **email**. \`TRACKED_EVENTS\` lists **19** Stripe types — checkout.session.completed through charge.refunded.

Theo lane (t3dotgg/stripe-recommendations): \`getOrCreateStripeCustomer\`, \`syncCustomerData\`, \`createPortalSession\`, brand/last4 on subscription payment method fields. Commit \`77812a0\` on 2026-02-06 is \`feat: implement Theo's Stripe recommendations\`. The compliance report file still opens with a summary table that marks several of those items Missing — stale header, live code.

![Theo helpers vs stale report header](/blog/stripe-convex-email-payments-theo-unpublished/screenshots/theo-compliance.png)

HEAD \`22e099e\` is PR **#13**: \`AddToCart\` gains \`isSubscription\` + \`planId\`; subscriptions default to direct checkout unless \`addToCart\` forces the cart path.

![AddToCart subscription compound API](/blog/stripe-convex-email-payments-theo-unpublished/screenshots/addtocart-subscription.png)

sitrep.md says **SHIPPED**. ROADMAP still has package publication unchecked. \`.github/workflows/publish.yml\` waits for a GitHub Release. Releases: **zero**. Public registry package stripe-convex: **404**. README still shows the version badge. LICENSE and README footer: **© Michael Shilman**. package.json author: Michael Hurley.

PENDING_ISSUES.md parks twelve real notes: Pay clearCart/addToCart race, unused onSuccess, Has returns null while loading, email checks only for \`@\`, duplicated formatPrice, cart not persisted, \`as any\` in syncCustomerData, and more.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/stripe-convex](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/stripe-convex) — **public**. No homepage / demo URL. Intended consumers named in ROADMAP: getat.me, hustlelaunch, other SaaS products. Revenue note in ROADMAP: **INDIRECT**.

![Badge vs registry 404](/blog/stripe-convex-email-payments-theo-unpublished/screenshots/registry-gap.png)

Local clone used for the pack: \`/home/michael/Projects/_site-map/stripe-convex\` on m1pro16. GitHub API shows **11** commits; that clone git log is squash-shaped to the single HEAD commit while the tree matches the library.

## When

**2026-02-04** — \`1a3d250\` Initial commit: stripe-convex payment package. Same day \`0f5b81c\` comprehensive docs.

**2026-02-06** — \`c38c209\` full type system + Convex functions. \`f608a74\` roadmap + license year. \`77812a0\` Theo recommendations.

**2026-02-11** — \`635c61c\` repo URLs + document all 19 webhook events.

**2026-02-21** — PR **#8** \`cd172db\`: dep conflicts, processRefund index, replace \`v.any()\`.

**2026-02-28** — PR **#11** CI/CD testing + publishing. Eight minutes later \`c1e4a39\`: remove GitHub Actions workflows — Vercel is our CI. \`publish.yml\` is still in the tree at HEAD.

**2026-03-01** — PR **#12** prep for registry publish.

**2026-03-20** — PR **#13** AddToCart subscription support → HEAD \`22e099e\`.

**2026-06-22** — GitHub \`pushed_at\` 22:20:53Z with no newer main commit beyond HEAD.

![Commit arc Feb to Mar 2026](/blog/stripe-convex-email-payments-theo-unpublished/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because every monetized Convex app was going to need the same Stripe spine, and copying webhook handlers is how you get drift.

Because email-first customers match the products that take payment before they finish auth.

Because Theo recommendations are a checklist I wanted encoded as exports, not a blog tab I reopen under pressure.

Because the honest scar is the unpublished registry: badge, workflow, prep PR, sitrep SHIPPED — and a 404.

**Engagement Q:** When sitrep says SHIPPED and the registry returns Not found — which status do you put in the blog title?

const BUNDX_INIT_CONTENT = `![Install flow](/blog/bundx-init-nextjs-unique-localhost-https-caddy/screenshots/install-flow.png)

## Who

I run a lot of Next.js apps side by side. Shared \`http://localhost:3000\` fights Clerk cookies, callback URLs, and \`allowedDevOrigins\` the second a second app boots.

For operators who need **stable HTTPS origins per repo** on a laptop — without hand-writing a Caddyfile every time.

## What

I built **bundx-init** — public \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/bundx-init\`. Shell CLI. HEAD \`c8b59ad\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. No tagged release.

\`bin/bundx-init\` is **379** lines. \`install.sh\` curls it into \`~/.local/bin\` (\`BUNDX_INIT_RAW_URL\` override). Target must be a Next project (\`package.json\` with \`next\`).

What it does (README + script):

- installs Caddy when possible (brew / apt Cloudsmith / dnf COPR / pacman)
- configures \`~/.local/etc/Caddyfile\` to import \`~/.local/etc/caddy/dev-sites/*.caddy\`
- writes a repo-scoped Caddy snippet
- adds \`scripts/dev-localhost.mjs\` + \`dev-localhost-info.mjs\`
- rewires \`package.json\` so \`dev\` runs the HTTPS flow (\`dev:raw\` keeps the old script; \`dev:info\` dumps JSON)
- patches \`next.config.*\` with \`allowedDevOrigins: ["<host>", "*.localhost"]\` when it can

Slug = basename lowercased. Host = \`<slug>.localhost\`. Port = \`3300 + (hash(slug) % 5000)\`. Fixture \`basic-next\` → port **6422**; README \`my-next-app\` → **6996**.

![Hostname / port map](/blog/bundx-init-nextjs-unique-localhost-https-caddy/screenshots/hostname-port-map.png)

Next still binds an internal high port. Caddy owns \`:443\` and reverse-proxies. Env: \`DEV_HOST\`, \`DEV_URL\`, \`PORT\`.

![Architecture](/blog/bundx-init-nextjs-unique-localhost-https-caddy/screenshots/architecture.png)

Fixture after init shows the patch contract: Next **16.2.1** / React **19.2.0**, \`dev\` → localhost script, \`allowedDevOrigins\` for \`basic-next.localhost\` + \`*.localhost\`.

![Repo patches](/blog/bundx-init-nextjs-unique-localhost-https-caddy/screenshots/repo-patches.png)

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/bundx-init](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/bundx-init) — public. No live web app.

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmonetized/bundx-init/main/install.sh | bash
bundx-init ~/Projects/my-next-app
cd ~/Projects/my-next-app && bun install && bun run dev
# → https://my-next-app.localhost
\`\`\`

## When

**2026-03-30** — \`3d4b752\` Initialize bundx-init (589 insertions: CLI, install, README, fixture).  
**2026-06-22** — \`f356360\` nightly adds \`.uncap/config.json\`.

![Commit arc](/blog/bundx-init-nextjs-unique-localhost-https-caddy/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because parallel Next apps on one port are a lie. Because Clerk and friends want real HTTPS origins in local. Because a hashed port + a Caddy snippet + \`allowedDevOrigins\` is the boring fix — and shipping it as a curl-install CLI beats copy-pasting the same five files forever.

**Engagement Q:** How many Next apps do you run locally before \`localhost:3000\` starts lying to your auth provider?

const ORCLAWSTRATOR_CONTENT = `![Orclawstrator TUI dashboard — projects, agents, branches, stacks](/blog/orclawstrator-swift-appkit-to-go-tui-openclaw-gateway/screenshots/tui-dashboard.png)

## Who

I wanted one keyboard surface for every AI coding agent I had running across \`~/Projects\` — not another Slack, not another browser tab of Vercel logs.

Who this is for: operators with an OpenClaw Gateway on localhost who need sessions, tokens, and dirty git state in one place. Builders who will open both \`swift-appkit/\` and \`tui/\` and ask which runtime is the product. Readers who already know I have three differently named “mission / command center” repos and need the OpenClaw-specific one named aloud.

If you have ever shipped a native Mac prototype in a weekend, then quietly made the terminal the recommended install path four months later — you are in the room.

## What

I built **Orclawstrator** — public **michaelmonetized/orclawstrator**, bundle **0.1.0**, **8** commits, HEAD \`01d9a20\`. README one-liner: *Command center for orchestrating AI coding agents across your entire project portfolio.* Lobster branding. “Built with 🦞 by the OpenClaw ecosystem.” GitHub description field: empty.

**Two UIs. One SQLite file.**

![OpenClaw Gateway REST + WebSocket session/token path](/blog/orclawstrator-swift-appkit-to-go-tui-openclaw-gateway/screenshots/openclaw-gateway.png)

Tree irony: Swift is still ~210KB of source vs ~39KB Go — linguist says Swift; README says use the TUI. \`sitrep.md\` last updated 2026-02-09 still calls the AppKit stack Active Development ~85%. \`AUTOPSY.md\` calls the Feb patient RESUSCITATED / ship-worthy. PLAN.md still has open Phase 4–6 checkboxes that the Feb code partially answered.

**Not** \`michaelmonetized/mission-control\` (p10k-style \`mc\` TUI, \`~/.hustlemc/\`, Phase 2 Fly/Claude SaaS scaffold). **Not** \`HurleyUS/hurley-mission-control\` (Clerk + Convex \`users.kind\` human|agent deliveries web).

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/orclawstrator](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/orclawstrator) — **public**, branch **main**. No dedicated homepage / Vercel lander.

![AppKit chromeless Catppuccin dashboard (archived path)](/blog/orclawstrator-swift-appkit-to-go-tui-openclaw-gateway/screenshots/appkit-dashboard.png)

Local surfaces: \`cd tui && make run\` · \`cd swift-appkit && swift build\` · cache \`~/.orclawstrator/cache.db\` · Gateway \`http://localhost:3377\` + \`ws://…/ws\`. Optional CLIs: \`gh\`, \`gt\`, \`vercel\`, Nerd Font.

Audience sits next to every multi-repo agent fleet that outgrew a single IDE chat panel — and next to my other two Mission Control names so the OpenClaw gateway story does not get stolen by the p10k TUI or the Convex comms plane.

## When

**2026-02-06** — Initial README + PLAN mockup. Same afternoon: AppKit prototype with dashboard + git. Same evening: MVP split view sidebar + dashboard.

**2026-02-08** — Core services wired, project detail, SQLite persistence. Later: chromeless semi-transparent window, full-width status bars.

**2026-02-09** — SwiftTerm for proper nvim terminal emulation in markdown tabs. AUTOPSY / inbox / shortcuts / PR stack / menu bar wave lands in the patient chart.

**2026-06-22** — \`nightly\`: move AppKit under \`swift-appkit/\`, add complete Go TUI + committed binary, flip README to TUI-recommended. Second \`nightly\` becomes HEAD \`01d9a20\` (18:15 ET). GitHub \`pushed_at\` 2026-06-22T22:15:42Z.

![Commit arc Feb sprint → Jun dual-runtime nightly](/blog/orclawstrator-swift-appkit-to-go-tui-openclaw-gateway/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

Eight commits. No post-June product commits in the log.

## Why

Because OpenClaw needed a portfolio command surface that spoke Gateway sessions and tokens — not just git dirty counts.

Because I could prove the AppKit path in four days (SwiftTerm nvim tabs included) and still decide the install story operators would actually run was \`make install\` in a terminal.

Because sharing \`~/.orclawstrator/cache.db\` across runtimes is the real monorepo bet; renaming folders under a \`nightly\` commit is how the bet got honest.

Because saying “mission control” three times in my GitHub org without naming which one talks to \`ws://localhost:3377/ws\` is how readers get the wrong pack.

**Engagement Q:** When README recommends the Go TUI but linguist still reports Swift — which runtime owns the product title?

const HUSTLEPAY_CONTENT = `![Guest claim flow](/blog/hustlepay-guest-claim-tokens-auth-agnostic-stripe/screenshots/guest-claim-flow.png)

## Who

I needed auth-agnostic Stripe+Convex glue so a guest can buy first and claim after signup — without marrying Clerk into the schema.

## What

Private **michaelmonetized/hustlepay** · hustlepay@0.0.0 · @hustlepay/core@0.0.1 · HEAD \`d2877fb\` · 1 commit nightly (+6957). Seven hp_* tables including hp_guest_sessions (gs_ + claim_ tokens). UI in core: Pay, Cart, Checkout, Has, ClaimAccount. @hustlepay/react still exports VERSION only; other adapters are stubs. Theo stripe-recommendations cited in stripe.ts.

![Schema tables](/blog/hustlepay-guest-claim-tokens-auth-agnostic-stripe/screenshots/schema-tables.png)

![Pay + ClaimAccount in core](/blog/hustlepay-guest-claim-tokens-auth-agnostic-stripe/screenshots/pay-claim-components.png)

## Where

github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlepay (private). No demo host for this tree. hustlepay.com → /lander. hustlepay.vercel.app = unrelated Nigeria micro-pension app. Sibling stripe-convex = email-tracking lineage; publish-stack names hustlepay for guest claim / Pay(199).

![Core vs adapters](/blog/hustlepay-guest-claim-tokens-auth-agnostic-stripe/screenshots/core-vs-adapters.png)

## When

2026-06-22 repo created; sole commit d2877fb nightly same day. No follow-ups.

![Domain irony](/blog/hustlepay-guest-claim-tokens-auth-agnostic-stripe/screenshots/domain-deploy-irony.png)

## Why

Guest rows without a claim bridge orphan purchases at signup. Auth-agnostic means userId is your Convex auth string. Core shipped the spine; the adapter billboard did not.

**Engagement Q:** When @hustlepay/react only exports VERSION, do you import Pay from @core — or wait for the TODOs?

const KITCHEN_COVER =
  "/blog/kitchen-cloud-native-project-store/cover.png";

const KITCHEN_CONTENT = `![Kitchen home — cloud-native project store](/blog/kitchen-cloud-native-project-store/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I got tired of treating Editor, disk, git, and remote hosting as four different systems for the same daily loop.

Kitchen is for operators who want live sync and a real editor — nvim, VS Code, Zed — without renaming the product a cloud IDE. It is for people who will say “no git” and mean no add/commit/push/pull/rebase, while history and human merge stay.

If you have ever saved a file and still had a ceremony left before another machine could see it, you are in the room.
## What

I built Kitchen (michaelmonetized/kitchen, web 0.1.0). Codename. Next 16.2.9 + Convex + Clerk + Mirror. HEAD 97bec56. 34 commits.

![Pricing](/blog/kitchen-cloud-native-project-store/screenshots/pricing.png)

## Where

Live https://kitchen-gilt-nine.vercel.app — home/pricing/docs/sign-in 200; discover 404; vision/mission 404 (untracked WT). Web is tree/diff/blame — not a textarea editor.

![Docs](/blog/kitchen-cloud-native-project-store/screenshots/docs.png)

## When

June 18 2026: public log opens at fork-merge; same day org-admin, collab-relay, landing, Vercel ship, recovery loops, then Mirror client, launch-gate, diff/blame, agent kit, offline queue. June 21 lakebed parity. June 22 nightly HEAD 97bec56. Pack day 2026-09-08 draft-only; WT dirty not pushed.

![Sign-in](/blog/kitchen-cloud-native-project-store/screenshots/sign-in.png)

## Why

Honest codename. Launch gate blocks PH/HN until Mirror demo is true. Dual honesty: marketing 200 vs discover 404 and WT docs drift. No git means no ceremony verbs — Versions and Pierre merge stay.

![Four layers](/blog/kitchen-cloud-native-project-store/screenshots/four-layers.png)

If your editor already saves to disk, what would have to be true before you deleted git add — live Versions on another machine, or a merge UI you trust more than conflict markers?

const HUSTLEMAIL_COVER =

const HUSTLEMAIL_CONTENT = `![Home hero](/blog/hustlemail-com-eight-dollar-lander-missing-signup/screenshots/home-hero.png)

## Who

I keep a private GitHub org full of product shells. Some are real apps. Some are landers that talk like apps.

For operators who need the honest split between a **$8/mo email-marketing marketing site** and the separate Resend mail-client monorepo that actually moves mail.

## What

I built **hustlemail-com** — private \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlemail-com\`. Next.js marketing shell. HEAD \`ab984f2\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. package name \`hustlemail.com@0.1.0\`. **No README.md**.

Stack facts from \`package.json\`: Next **^16.2.6**, React **^19.2.6**, Tailwind **^4.3.0**, Bun lockfile. Dependencies stop there — no Clerk, no Convex, no Stripe package, no Resend.

What the UI claims:

- Hero: “Email marketing, **minus the bloat**.” CTAs to \`/signup\` and \`/docs\`.
- Social proof strip: **10K+ Active Users** / **50M+ Emails Sent** — no backend in this tree to back that.
- Competitor cards: Mailchimp \`$20+/mo\`, ConvertKit \`$29+/mo\`, HustleMail **\`$8/mo\`**.
- Pricing: **Starter Free** (500 subs / 1,000 emails), **Pro $8/mo** (5,000 subs, unlimited emails, sequences, A/B, custom branding), **Business $24/mo** (25,000, dedicated IP, API, phone). Annual Pro copy: **$80/year**.
- FAQ text says Stripe + PayPal, 14-day trial, 30-day refund — still no Stripe in deps.
- Brand red: Tailwind \`brand.500 = #ef4444\`.

![Pricing plans](/blog/hustlemail-com-eight-dollar-lander-missing-signup/screenshots/pricing-plans.png)

![Competitor table](/blog/hustlemail-com-eight-dollar-lander-missing-signup/screenshots/competitor-table.png)

Real \`page.tsx\` routes: \`/\`, \`/features\`, \`/pricing\`, \`/docs\`.

Linked but **missing**: \`/signup\`, \`/login\`, \`/about\`, \`/blog\`, \`/contact\`, \`/privacy\`, \`/terms\`, \`/community\`, and the docs children (\`/docs/quick-start\`, \`/docs/api\`, …). \`/docs\` is an index of cards pointing at pages that do not exist.

![Missing routes](/blog/hustlemail-com-eight-dollar-lander-missing-signup/screenshots/missing-routes.png)

This is **not** \`michaelmonetized/hustlemail\` — that sibling is a Resend+Convex keyboard-first mail client for \`notify@uncap.us\`. Different repo. Different job.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlemail-com](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlemail-com) — private.

Live probes at pack time:

- \`hustlemail-com.vercel.app\` / \`hustlemail.vercel.app\` → **404** \`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND\`
- \`hustlemail.com\` DNS A → **54.243.117.197** (AWS); HTTPS TLS → **UNEXPECTED_EOF** (not this Next app)

Local inspect clone: \`/tmp/cf-inspect/hustlemail-com\` @ \`ab984f2\`.

## When

**2026-02-18** — \`286bef3\` feat: initial hustlemail.com marketing site (+1469 / 15 files).  
**2026-06-22 17:38 ET** — \`e96ceb6\` nightly (Fallow hooks, AGENTS.md, REVIEW.md, \`.uncap\`, dep bumps).  
**2026-06-22 18:16 ET** — \`ab984f2\` nightly empty tip (HEAD).

![Commit arc](/blog/hustlemail-com-eight-dollar-lander-missing-signup/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because a lander that prices against ConvertKit still needs a \`/signup\` route before it is a product story. Because 10K+/50M+ on a four-page private repo is copy, not telemetry. Because the real mail work in this org lives in the Resend client — and this pack refuses to merge those narratives.

**Engagement Q:** How many of your “$8/mo SaaS” repos are four marketing pages with a missing \`/signup\`?
`;

const NVIBE_COVER =
  "/blog/nvibe-neovim-cursor-coderabbit-layout-until-it-works/cover.png";

const NVIBE_CONTENT = `![nvibe layout — left AI panel, editor, bottom tools](/blog/nvibe-neovim-cursor-coderabbit-layout-until-it-works/screenshots/layout-concept.png)

## Who

I wanted Cursor Agent and CodeRabbit **already open** when Neovim started — not behind another tmux pane, not in a separate Electron window, not one \`<leader>\` chord away from forgetting which split I was in.

If you run NvChad and keep AI CLIs on PATH, you already know the friction: alt-tab to the agent, lose the buffer context, come back, rebalance windows by hand. I wanted the layout to be the product.

## What

I built **nvibe** — a Lua Neovim plugin at [michaelmonetized/nvibe](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/nvibe). Version badge says **0.1.0**. Module lives at \`lua/nvibe/init.lua\` (~354 lines). Public. Stars: 0.

On \`VimEnter\`, if you are not already in a terminal buffer, \`setup()\` calls \`create_terminal_split()\`:

1. Hard-requires \`nvchad.term\` (ERROR notify + abort if missing).
2. Checks \`vim.fn.executable\` for \`cursor_agent_cmd\` / \`coderabbit_cmd\` (defaults \`cursor-agent\`, \`coderabbit\`).
3. Left panel width = \`width_percent\` × \`$COLS\` (or \`vim.o.columns\` fallback).
4. \`nvchad.term.new\` for Cursor Agent (top) and CodeRabbit (bottom) on that panel.
5. Bottom strip: LazyGit + two shells (\`vim.o.shell\`), with a pile of \`wincmd\` / \`close\` cleanup so empty buffers do not stick around.
6. \`stopinsert\` so the editor is not left in insert mode.

Config surface is small:

\`\`\`lua
require('nvibe').setup({
  width_percent = 30,
  cursor_agent_cmd = "cursor-agent",
  coderabbit_cmd = "coderabbit",
})
\`\`\`

Honesty check against the tree: the **code default** for \`width_percent\` is **20**, while README / \`docs/API.md\` / busted expectations still talk like **30**. LazyGit and the dual shells are **hardcoded** — not setup opts. ROADMAP still has "make bottom panel commands and sizes configurable" open.

![NvimTree #4/#5 — height constrain + rebalance](/blog/nvibe-neovim-cursor-coderabbit-layout-until-it-works/screenshots/nvimtree-fix.png)

February fix (\`6a931f6\`, closes #4 and #5): opening NvimTree used to equalize windows and grow full height over the terminal panes. Plugin now caches editor-row height after layout, constrains \`FileType NvimTree\` windows to that height, and \`rebalance_panels()\` restores left-column terminal widths on open/close. README documents \`preserve_window_proportions = true\` as the paired NvimTree setting.

Tests: busted (\`tests/test_nvibe.lua\`, **18** \`it(\` cases) with mocked \`vim\` + \`nvchad.term\`. Makefile: \`make test\` / \`lint\` / \`check\` via busted + luacheck. CHANGELOG documents the early interactivity bug — raw \`vim.cmd("terminal …")\` vs NvChad's interactive \`term.new\`.

![CI added, then deleted for Vercel](/blog/nvibe-neovim-cursor-coderabbit-layout-until-it-works/screenshots/ci-vercel-irony.png)

CI subplot: \`3ee0092\` added \`.github/workflows/build.yml\` ("keep prod build green"). \`5ab79db\` corrected it for a Lua project. Next morning \`365a17e\` deleted **all** GitHub config with message **“Vercel is our only CI/CD”** — on a Neovim Lua plugin with no web app in the tree. HEAD has no \`.github/\`. Local \`make test\` is the gate that remains.

Also true: MIT badge in README, **no LICENSE file**. Product Hunt badges link to producthunt.com root. PLAN.md still has Phase 3 "Product Hunt launch preparation." CHANGELOG dates 0.1.0 as 2025-01-17; git history starts **2025-10-17**.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/nvibe](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/nvibe) — **public**. No hosted demo.

Install path in README: Lazy.nvim or Packer snippets calling \`require('nvibe').setup()\`, after NvChad. Runtime needs Neovim 0.7+, NvChad (\`nvchad.term\`), and the CLIs you configured (plus \`lazygit\` for the bottom middle pane as written).

Checked-in \`screenshot.png\` (~948KB) from the Oct 18 roadmap commit is the visual proof the layout existed on a real session.

## When

- **2025-10-17 morning** — \`a65bb50\` init → \`e0766a4\` initial plugin release → Product Hunt marketing README (\`be96f88\`) → docs, tests, NvChad error handling, CodeRabbit PR cleanup → merge #2.
- **2025-10-17 evening – 2025-10-18** — bottom panel / 3-column layout fight: auto-launch, separate creation paths, sizing context bugs, manual vim-cmd walking (\`i've been using 1 not l but needed h\`) → **\`903e4d6\` "it works!"** → merge #3 from \`stage\` → \`5a790f2\` roadmap + screenshot.
- **2026-02-21** — \`6a931f6\` NvimTree height + panel width restore (closes #4, #5).
- **2026-02-27–28** — Actions build gate → Lua workflow fix → delete GitHub config for Vercel; PLAN.md + \`.hustlemc\` land.
- **2026-06-22** — \`e7833a1\` / HEAD \`56d0152\` nightlies. Last push \`2026-06-22T22:17:08Z\`. **35** commits total.

![35-commit arc highlights](/blog/nvibe-neovim-cursor-coderabbit-layout-until-it-works/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because "vibe coding" for me is not another chat sidebar — it is **terminals I already pay for**, laid out so the agent and the reviewer never leave the frame while I edit.

I also wanted the diary of actually making Neovim splits behave. The commit messages from Oct 18 are the product as much as the README ASCII: simplify, comment out close, walk the steps, use \`h\` not \`1\`, then ship **"it works!"** Same energy as deleting a brand-new Actions workflow because the org mantra said Vercel — leave that commit in history instead of rewriting it.

## Engagement Q

Would you hard-depend on **NvChad's terminal module** to glue Cursor Agent + CodeRabbit into Neovim — or keep AI in separate panes forever — and does a commit titled **"it works!"** after a day of \`wincmd\` hell earn more trust than a polished 0.1.0 badge?
`;

const COMPARE_COVER =
  "/blog/compare-git-isolated-command-benchmarker/cover.png";

const COMPARE_CONTENT = `![Git-isolated A/B workflow](/blog/compare-git-isolated-command-benchmarker/screenshots/workflow-isolation.png)

## Who

I kept running \`time cmd-a; time cmd-b\` and then arguing with myself about whether the second one won because it was faster — or because the first one warmed the cache and the tree had drifted.

For operators comparing formatters and linters who refuse that lie. Especially anyone already typing \`vp exec biome format --write\` next to \`vp exec oxlint\` and wanting the median, not the vibes.

## What

I built **compare** — public [\`michaelmonetized/compare\`](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/compare). Bash. \`VERSION="0.1.0"\`. \`bin/compare\` is **825** lines at HEAD (468 on init). \`install.sh\` drops it in \`/usr/local/bin\` (or \`$PREFIX\`). HEAD \`c5dbcd6\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. CLI only. No LICENSE. No release tag.

![CLI help surface](/blog/compare-git-isolated-command-benchmarker/screenshots/cli-help.png)

The product is git isolation for shell A/B:

1. If the working tree is dirty, commit \`compare: snapshot before benchmark\` (with \`--no-verify\`).
2. Force-create \`compare/<slug-a>\` and \`compare/<slug-b>\` from that shared SHA.
3. Checkout A, run command A \`-n\` times with \`TIMEFORMAT\`, append to the log; blank line; same for B.
4. Restore the original branch. Leave the snapshot and \`compare/*\` branches for inspection — delete them yourself.

Log lines look like POSIX \`time\`:

\`\`\`text
vp exec biome lint --write  1.36s user 0.36s system 151% cpu 1.134 total
vp exec oxlint --write  0.21s user 0.18s system 73% cpu 0.528 total
\`\`\`

Default path: \`../tests/compare-<cwd>-<c1>-<c2>-<UTCstamp>.log\`. Flags: \`-n\`, \`-c\`, \`-o\`, \`-g/--graph\`, \`--md\`. Subcommands: \`compare graph <log>\`, \`compare report <log>\`. Graphs: user / system / CPU% / total — blue A, yellow B. \`--md\` writes tables + mermaid and opens [mdr](https://github.com/CleverCloud/mdr) (else \`open\` / \`xdg-open\`). Commands go through \`eval\` — trusted only.

![Sample log + terminal charts](/blog/compare-git-isolated-command-benchmarker/screenshots/sample-log-graph.png)

Smoke on the pack box: \`compare "sleep 0.05" "sleep 0.12" -n 3\` → totals ~0.051 vs ~0.121, branches \`compare/sleep-0-05\` and \`compare/sleep-0-12\` left behind. README caveats remain honest: no CPU pinning, mutating commands can diverge branches, one intentional variable is on you.

Residue: \`plans/README.md\` still says the repo had **no commits and no source code** — docs-only improve plans. Those four plans are marked DONE. \`compare report\` is in \`--help\` and code; it is not in the README Contents. Second nightly (\`c5dbcd6\`) shares the exact tree with the first nightly — empty HEAD commit.

![plans irony](/blog/compare-git-isolated-command-benchmarker/screenshots/plans-irony.png)

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/compare](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/compare) — public, branch \`main\`. No homepage. No live web demo. Clone + \`./install.sh\` (or \`PREFIX=$HOME/.local ./install.sh\`).

Audience sits next to biome, oxlint, Vite Plus, and anyone who already treats \`time\` output as courtroom evidence.

## When

**2026-06-17, 6:57 AM Eastern.** \`217d4ac\` init — README, 468-line CLI, install script, four docs plans.

**2026-06-22, 5:40 PM Eastern.** \`b4fea7b\` nightly — CLI grows to 825 lines; README gains \`--md\` / mdr / CPU chart.

**2026-06-22, 6:17 PM Eastern.** \`c5dbcd6\` nightly — same tree as \`b4fea7b\`. HEAD. Empty.

![Commit arc](/blog/compare-git-isolated-command-benchmarker/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because back-to-back \`time\` is a shared-state measurement pretending to be a tool measurement. Because a snapshot commit plus two named branches is the smallest honest isolator I would actually run. Because biome-vs-oxlint needs a log file outside the working tree, not another Slack debate.

**Engagement Q:** When you A/B two CLIs, what is the one variable you pretend you controlled — and which dirty-tree / warm-cache factor actually won?

## Who

I wanted Flappy Bird that lives in the TTY — not a browser tab — and I kept a pure-bash platformer under the same repo name because the first instinct was bash + former, not Ink clone.

For people who install Bun and still respect a 300-line bash game that only needs Nerd Fonts.

## What

I built **bashformer** — public https://github.com/michaelmonetized/bashformer. HEAD \`541d2bc\`. **21** commits. **0** stars. Default **master**. Version **Unreleased**. CLI/TTY only.

**Product A (README):** \`index.tsx\` (~263 LOC). Bun + React 19 + Ink 7. CONFIG: FPS 30, GRAVITY 0.32, FLAP_VY -1.7, PIPE_SPEED 3.1, PIPE_GAP 8. Space flaps/restarts; Q quits. Pipe.scored prevents double-count (\`d1fa8d0\`, #7). Terminal <40x10 exits (\`6678fda\`).

![CONFIG + scored](/blog/bashformer-ink-flappy-after-c-sdl-cleanup/screenshots/config-scored-fix.png)

**Product B (in-tree):** \`bashformer.sh\` (~314 LOC). Pure bash Nerd Font side-scroller — coins/spikes/goal, camera follow. A/D move, W/Space jump, Q quit.

![Bash platformer HUD](/blog/bashformer-ink-flappy-after-c-sdl-cleanup/screenshots/bash-platformer-hud.png)

**Feb 21 cleanup:** CONFIG extract (\`6b9eead\`), PLAN rewrite (\`e27c79b\`), bun tests (\`810e5f4\`), remove vex_sdl (#14) and C/SDL (\`5a840cf\`), CHANGELOG (#11), README match, scored flag, term size.

Residue: PLAN still lists deleted C experiments; sitrep says Unknown tool / PROTOTYPE; CHANGELOG [Unreleased]; package.json private.

**2025-12-21 -> 12-27** — init, kong/baddies/tools, zoom/png, story cleanup.
**2026-01-31** — chore sync.
**2026-02-21** — CONFIG -> tests -> delete C/SDL -> scored flag -> term size.
**2026-06-22** — nightly x2 -> HEAD \`541d2bc\`.

![Commit arc](/blog/bashformer-ink-flappy-after-c-sdl-cleanup/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because deleting the C/SDL pile is a product decision. Because Pipe.scored is more honest than score feels off. Because Unreleased with empty Phase 1 checkboxes beats inventing a 1.0 tag.

**Engagement Q:** Keep the pure-bash platformer beside Ink Flappy, or split so the README stops lying by omission?

2024-08-21 init · 2024-08-23 Google Sites iframe commit · 2026-01-31 sync (+ STRIPE.md) · 2026-02-27 package.json · 2026-06-22 nightly rewrite \`7881d00\` · empty nightly HEAD \`5c4661c\` same day.

![ROADMAP irony](/blog/redactthing-streamer-pii-mv3-jquery-ghost-iframe-gap/screenshots/roadmap-irony.png)

## Why

Streamer PII is a content-script problem. The repo still ships the unused jQuery, the 404 lander, and a ROADMAP for a different product. The iframe limit is documented in a commit subject.

**Engagement Q:** Vanilla MutationObserver already shipped — delete the jQuery ghost tonight, or carry 84KB into the store listing?

const HUSTLEDESK_CONTENT = `![Home hero](/blog/hustledesk-com-eight-dollar-helpdesk-lander-wordpress-domain/screenshots/home-hero.png)

## Who

I keep a private GitHub org full of product shells. Some are real apps. Some are landers that talk like apps. Some claim a domain that answers something else entirely.

For operators who need the honest split between a **$8/mo flat helpdesk marketing site** and the **WordPress parking page** currently living at hustledesk.com.

## What

I built **hustledesk-com** — private \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustledesk-com\`. Next.js marketing shell. HEAD \`d446e97\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. package name \`hustledesk.com@0.1.0\`. README is **stock** create-next-app boilerplate.

Stack facts from \`package.json\`: Next **16.2.6**, React **19.2.6**, Tailwind **^4.3.0**, Bun lockfile. Dependencies stop there — no Clerk, no Convex, no Stripe package, no IMAP/email inbound library.

What the UI claims:

- Hero: “Support tickets, **nothing more**.” Subhead inbox zero. Price line **$8/mo. Really.**
- CTAs: **Start Free Trial** → \`https://app.hustledesk.com/signup\`, **See Features** → \`/features\`. Header **Sign in** → \`https://app.hustledesk.com/login\`.
- Home **inbox mock**: Sarah Chen “Can't reset password” (SLA: 28m left), Mike Johnson, Emily Davis — chrome window, not a product screenshot.
- Feature grid: Email Inbound, Ticket Inbox, Canned Responses, SLA Timers, Team Assignment, **HustleChat Integration**.
- Competitor cards: Zendesk \`$55+\`, Freshdesk \`$18+\`, Help Scout \`$25+\` (per user) vs HustleDesk **\`$8\` flat · Unlimited users**.
- Pricing: **one** plan — $8/month flat; team-of-5 table ends at Zendesk **$3,300/yr** vs HustleDesk **$96/yr** (“Save $3,204/year…”).
- Brand sky: Tailwind \`--color-hustle-500 = #0ea5e9\` / \`600 = #0284c7\`.

![Competitor table](/blog/hustledesk-com-eight-dollar-helpdesk-lander-wordpress-domain/screenshots/competitor-table.png)

Real \`page.tsx\` routes: \`/\`, \`/features\`, \`/pricing\`, \`/docs\`.

Linked but **missing in-repo**: \`/privacy\`, \`/terms\`, and the docs children (\`/docs/quick-start\`, \`/docs/email-forwarding\`, \`/docs/api\`, \`/docs/hustlechat\`, …). \`/docs\` is an index of cards pointing at pages that do not exist.

![Docs dead links](/blog/hustledesk-com-eight-dollar-helpdesk-lander-wordpress-domain/screenshots/docs-dead-links.png)

![Missing routes + app 301](/blog/hustledesk-com-eight-dollar-helpdesk-lander-wordpress-domain/screenshots/missing-routes.png)

This is **not** \`hustlemail-com\` — that sibling is the **email-marketing** $8 lander (red \`#ef4444\`, Free/$8/$24, in-repo missing \`/signup\`). Different product claim. Different brand. Different honesty bug.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/hustledesk-com](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustledesk-com) — private.

Live probes at pack time:

- \`hustledesk.com\` DNS A → **66.96.162.142**; HTTPS **200** WordPress PHP/7.4.33; title **Hustle Desk – Make extra income from the comfort of your home**; default “This is your front page” copy — **not** this Next helpdesk lander
- \`www\` / \`app.hustledesk.com\` → same A; \`app\` **301** \`X-Redirect-By: WordPress\` → \`https://hustledesk.com/\`
- \`hustledesk-com.vercel.app\` → **404** \`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND\`
- \`hustledesk.vercel.app\` → unrelated Vite SPA (\`<title>hustledesk</title>\`)

Local inspect clone: \`/tmp/cf-inspect/hustledesk-com\` @ \`d446e97\`.

## When

**2026-02-18 07:57 ET** — \`4439645\` feat: initial hustledesk.com marketing site (+2206 / 22 files).  
**2026-06-22 17:23 ET** — \`b45b480\` nightly (Fallow hooks, AGENTS.md, REVIEW.md, \`.uncap\`, dep bumps).  
**2026-06-22 18:14 ET** — \`d446e97\` nightly empty tip (HEAD).

![Commit arc](/blog/hustledesk-com-eight-dollar-helpdesk-lander-wordpress-domain/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because a Zendesk-price lander still needs an auth surface that is not a WordPress 301. Because “Save $3,204/year” on a four-page private repo is table copy, not a billed product. Because hustlemail-com already told the $8 lander story for email marketing — this pack is the **helpdesk** twin with a **domain that answers something else**.

**Engagement Q:** How many of your SaaS domains currently serve a default WordPress “Make extra income” front page while the Next lander never shipped?

const SHIPPREP_COVER =
  "/blog/shipprep-default-apply-biome-tsgo-blacksmith-vercel-off/cover.png";

const SHIPPREP_CONTENT = `## Who

I got tired of re-typing the same Biome/tsgo/Blacksmith/Vercel-off checklist into every Next/Bun root — so the checklist became a CLI that **applies by default**.

For operators who want Vercel Git auto-deploy **off** on main/master and Blacksmith owning \`vercel deploy --prebuilt\`.

## What

I built **shipprep** — private https://github.com/michaelmonetized/shipprep. HEAD \`c35a9d8\`. **6** commits. **0** stars. Version **0.1.0**. No README.

\`bin/shipprep.mts\` (**403** LOC). Shebang Bun. \`parseArgs\` defaults \`apply: true\`. \`--audit\` / \`--check\` flips read-only. Accepts em-dash \`—pwd\` from chat typography.

![APPLY report](/blog/shipprep-default-apply-biome-tsgo-blacksmith-vercel-off/screenshots/apply-report.png)

**APPLY** writes package scripts (\`tsc\`/\`typecheck\` → \`tsgo --noEmit\`, \`lint\` → biome-lint), tsconfig bun+node + \`**/*.mts\`, \`scripts/dev-localhost*.mjs\`, \`scripts/ship.mts\`, freview \`pre-push\`, \`.github/workflows/ship.yml\` on \`blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404\`, and \`vercel.json\` with \`git.deploymentEnabled.main/master = false\`.

![Audit checks](/blog/shipprep-default-apply-biome-tsgo-blacksmith-vercel-off/screenshots/audit-checks.png)

Required roots for validRoot: \`package.json\`, \`bun.lock\`, \`.vercel\`, \`.next\`. Tests in \`test/shipprep.test.ts\` (**122** LOC).

## Where

Code only: [github.com/michaelmonetized/shipprep](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/shipprep) — **private**. No live site.

\`\`\`bash
bun bin/shipprep.mts --pwd ~/Projects/app
bun bin/shipprep.mts --audit --json
\`\`\`

## When

**2026-05-13 14:08→14:54** — audit → false positives → APPLY default → Vercel git off.  
**2026-06-22** — nightly ×2 → \`.uncap\` → HEAD \`c35a9d8\`.

![Commit arc](/blog/shipprep-default-apply-biome-tsgo-blacksmith-vercel-off/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because audit-only tools leave you copy-pasting. Because Blacksmith prebuilt + Vercel git disabled is a **gate**, not a README hope. Because this is not shipthing (contacts CRM) and not bundx-init (\`.localhost\` only).

**Engagement Q:** Keep APPLY as the default, or flip to \`--audit\` default so a typo cannot rewrite twelve package scripts?

const IPRO_COVER =
  "/blog/ipro-golf-agency-lander-ecosystem-hub/cover.png";

const IPRO_CONTENT = `![iPro.golf agency homepage mock — hero, ecosystem chips, services](/blog/ipro-golf-agency-lander-ecosystem-hub/screenshots/home.png)

## Who

I ship golf products that look like one brand family and are three different businesses. [iLeague.golf](https://ileague.golf) is the creator platform — scorecards, subscriptions, tips, fifteen percent fee. That pack already exists: \`ileague-golf-patreon-meets-18birdies\`. [iTour.golf](https://www.itour.golf) is the national creator-tour lander — sponsors, host bids, season schema — packed as \`itour-golf-tour-lander-ahead-of-deploy\`.

iPro.golf is the **agency**. Country clubs, courses, resorts. Retainers. Case-study theater. A brochure that also hubs the ecosystem.

If you care about multi-domain Vercel rewrites, agency landers that declare Stripe/Clerk/Convex and never wire them, or how not to steal the creator-SaaS story when the URL says “Pro”: this is the field notes.

## What

I keep the live marketing site for the agency under \`HurleyUS/iPro-main-web\`.

README one-liner: connective tissue between influencers and golf courses, country clubs, resorts, and growing golf communities. Layout title that also wins on curl: **iPro.golf | Golf Course & Resort Marketing Agency**. Badge on the hero: the same phrase. H1: **iPro.golf**.

Stack on the box: **Next.js 16.2**, **React 19**, Tailwind v4, Geist, a full shadcn/Radix tree, Bun lockfile, Vercel. Package name **web**, version **0.1.0**. Repo private. Site public at [www.ipro.golf](https://www.ipro.golf) (apex 308s to www). Ten commits. HEAD \`b8dfdba\`.

![Retainer pricing mock — Starter / Growth / Premium](/blog/ipro-golf-agency-lander-ecosystem-hub/screenshots/services-pricing.png)

This is **not** the creator billing product and **not** the tour season product.

Money on the home page is blunt agency retainers:

1. **Starter** — $1,997/mo (refresh, social setup, GBP, reporting)  
2. **Growth** — $4,997/mo (most popular — full social, email, content, paid, strategy)  
3. **Premium** — $9,997+/mo (video, influencer campaigns, events, member acquisition, dedicated team)

Services grid: Brand Design, Web Development, Social Media, Local SEO, Email Marketing, Video Production. CTAs go to \`/contact\` and \`/case-studies\`.

What is also true on pack day:

- **Live www title matches HEAD** — unlike the iTour pack where production still serves a fake 2026 season shell.  
- \`layout.tsx\` points Open Graph at \`/og-image.png\`. That file is **not** in \`public/\`. curl → **404**.  
- Contact \`handleSubmit\` is a one-second \`setTimeout\` with a TODO for Resend. Phone is **(555) GOLF-PRO**. Email \`hello@ipro.golf\`.  
- Case studies (Highland Links, Coastal Resort & Spa, Valley Municipal) are fiction. Feb 9 AUTOPSY said the quiet part out loud; home metrics later sit at 50+ / 35% / 2.5x / $1.8M instead of the autopsy’s 120+ / 47% / $2.4M.  
- \`package.json\` still lists Clerk, Stripe, Convex, PostHog, Resend, react-email. Fallow REVIEW: unused. No \`convex/\` tree. No \`app/api\`. Layout has no Clerk provider.  
- \`/ileague\`, \`/itour\`, \`/iconf\` on this repo are **Coming Soon / waitlist shells**. The real products are separate repos and separate packs.  
- Agency \`/itour\` copy still says **National Amateur Golf Tour** and a 2026 regional event grid — that fights the packed iTour creator-tour / May 2027 story. Call the conflict; do not merge the posts.  
- Private vault \`michaelmonetized/iPro\` is already **SKIP** — logos, planning markdown, gitlink into this app. Do not retell it here.

![Ecosystem differentiation — agency vs creator SaaS vs tour vs summit](/blog/ipro-golf-agency-lander-ecosystem-hub/screenshots/ecosystem-diff.png)

## Where

It runs on Vercel as a prerendered marketing site (\`x-nextjs-prerender: 1\` on the 2026-09-08 probe). Dark theme, fixed header, footer with Services / Ecosystem / Company columns.

Surfaces that matter:

- Public agency pages — home, about, services, case studies, contact, blog listing, privacy, terms  
- Ecosystem brochure pages — \`/ileague\` Coming Soon, \`/itour\` Coming 2026, \`/iconf\` Fall 2026  
- \`proxy.ts\` — if host is \`iconference.golf\` or \`www.iconference.golf\` and path is \`/\`, rewrite to \`/iconf\`. Live iconference.golf returns **200** with \`x-matched-path: /iconf\`  
- shadcn kit under \`components/ui/*\` — mostly unused; used pieces are Button, Sheet, form controls on contact  

Live HTML on pack day did **not** need Clerk keys to render. There is no auth wall on the agency brochure.

![Honesty board — live wins vs remaining gaps](/blog/ipro-golf-agency-lander-ecosystem-hub/screenshots/honesty-board.png)

Related domains: **iPro.golf** (emerald agency — this pack), **iLeague.golf** (creator platform — packed), **iTour.golf** (tour — packed), **iConference.golf** (summit shell rewritten onto this project). Vault sibling SKIPPED.

## When

**November 24, 2025.** Create Next App. Init thrash. Empty license. Another init. The repo exists before the golf pitch is real.

**February 5, 2026.** \`chore: prod deploy\` — first push toward something live.

**February 9.** The meaningful day. \`feat: Complete site rebuild with pages, navigation, and proper structure\` — the App Router surface that still matches www. Same day: AUTOPSY updated with GoDaddy DNS instructions and a brutal inventory of placeholders. DNS later got fixed; the autopsy file did not get a matching rewrite.

**May 21.** \`Fix iConference domain deployment\` — CHANGELOG: production routing for iconference.golf onto the iPro Vercel project + UI compatibility so the Next production build passes. \`proxy.ts\` is the host rewrite.

**June 22.** Two \`nightly\` commits. HEAD \`b8dfdba\`. Package deps float forward; the brochure story does not.

## Why

Because the ecosystem needs a front door that sells **services to properties** without pretending it is the creator SaaS or the tour.

Because operators reading three golf posts in a row deserve a clean split: agency retainers here, Patreon×18Birdies there, sponsor/host season over there.

Because a domain rewrite for iconference.golf onto \`/iconf\` is a real ops story — and a Coming Soon waitlist is not the same as shipping iConference.

Because the vault repo will keep tempting people to package logos as a product. It is not. This app is.

**Engagement question:** When the agency lander links to Coming Soon ecosystem shells that already have live product domains elsewhere — do you keep the hub honest as a brochure, or do you outbound-link straight to the real products and delete the shells?

const FREVIEW_CONTENT = `![Five marketed reviews vs six REVIEW.md sections](/blog/freview-five-reviews-six-sections-observability-gate/screenshots/six-sections.png)

## Who

I got tired of “we’ll catch it in CI” turning into a Slack autopsy after \`main\` already moved. Pre-push should hurt a little when the tree is sketchy and stay quiet when it is clean.

For JS/TS teams (and anyone whose public symbols need docstrings across TS/Swift/Rust/Python/shell) who want one command, one durable \`REVIEW.md\`, and the same gate locally and on Blacksmith.

## What

I built **freview** — public [\`HurleyUS/freview\`](https://github.com/HurleyUS/freview). Package \`@hurleyus/freview\` **0.1.0**. MIT. zsh. \`bin/freview\` is **404** lines; bundled \`bin/scribe\` is **555**. HEAD \`23237d9\`. **22** commits. 0 stars. CLI / package only.

![CLI / section pipeline](/blog/freview-five-reviews-six-sections-observability-gate/screenshots/six-sections.png)

The README and \`TWITTER-RELEASE-THREAD.md\` still sell **“One command. Five reviews.”** The orchestrator always appends **six** sections into root \`REVIEW.md\`:

1. **OBSERVABILITY** — embedded Python: detect Next / React Native-Expo / Electron / Swift; require Sentry + PostHog deps, init, and env-signal strings; if \`.vercel/project.json\` exists, \`vercel env ls production\` must show the DSN/key/host set. Library/tooling repos with no platform → pass.
2. **HEALTH** — \`bunx --bun fallow … health --complexity\` (soft-pass when exit≠0 but no fail glyphs)
3. **AUDIT** — \`fallow audit\`
4. **DEAD** — \`fallow dead-code\`
5. **DUPLICATION** — \`fallow dupes\`
6. **DOCSTRINGS** — bundled \`scribe\` (not Michael’s old \`~/bin/scribe\`)

Before any of that: \`fallow init\` + \`fallow setup-hooks\`, then freview rewrites the Claude \`fallow-gate.sh\` matcher from \`git commit|push\` → **\`git push\` only** so local commits stay unblocked.

Flags you actually use: \`--root\`, \`--format\`, \`--quiet\`, \`--explain\`, \`--summary\`, \`--ci\` (SARIF + quiet + fail-on-issues), \`--fail-on-issues\`. Clean runs write the file and shut up. Dirty runs print the report and exit 1. Empty SARIF result sets do not fail CI mode.

![Observability platforms](/blog/freview-five-reviews-six-sections-observability-gate/screenshots/observability-platforms.png)

Install paths: curl both bins into \`~/bin\`, clone + symlink, or \`bunx github:HurleyUS/freview\` / \`bun link\`. Pre-push snippet in the README only fires on protected \`main\`/\`master\` refs.

Residue / irony: shell-only package — \`scripts.lint\` and \`scripts.check\` are literally \`true\` — yet \`.github/workflows/ci.yml\` still installs zsh and runs \`bunx --bun github:HurleyUS/freview --ci\` on \`blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404\`. May 14 is seven commits all titled **“Standardize Blacksmith CI gates.”** May 14 also briefly committed generated Claude hooks, deleted them seventeen minutes later, then re-tracked them a week later. Second June 22 nightly (\`23237d9\`) shares the exact tree with the \`.uncap\` nightly — empty HEAD.

![Blacksmith CI self-review](/blog/freview-five-reviews-six-sections-observability-gate/screenshots/ci-blacksmith.png)

## Where

Code: [github.com/HurleyUS/freview](https://github.com/HurleyUS/freview) — public, branch \`main\`. No homepage. No live web demo. Sibling tooling surface: Fallow + Claude Code hooks + Blacksmith runners.

## When

**2026-05-13, 1:41–1:51 PM Eastern.** Init (150-line freview) → Twitter thread → bundle scribe + package.json.

**2026-05-13, 7:23–8:06 PM Eastern.** Observability gate → platform-aware rewrite (Next/RN/Electron/Swift + Vercel env).

**2026-05-14 afternoon Eastern.** Blacksmith CI standardization spam → empty SARIF handling → avoid oxlint on shell-only → hook churn → prettier CI commit.

**2026-05-21 morning Eastern.** Empty health soft-pass (PR #1) → track fallow Claude hook → push-only gate + freview rewriter.

**2026-06-22, 5:20 PM Eastern.** \`8fd392a\` nightly — \`.uncap/config.json\`.

**2026-06-22, 6:12 PM Eastern.** \`23237d9\` nightly — empty tree. HEAD.

![Commit arc](/blog/freview-five-reviews-six-sections-observability-gate/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because terminal scrollback is a graveyard and \`REVIEW.md\` is not. Because “five reviews” was the pitch and observability became the sixth section the docs never renumbered. Because a pre-push hook that also rewrites your Claude gate to push-only is the kind of boring guardrail I actually leave installed.

**Engagement Q:** If your pre-push suite marketed five checks, which sixth gate would you sneak in first — observability, license, or “did CI prettier already fight you”?

const HUSTLECONVERT_CONTENT = `![Home hero](/blog/hustleconvert-com-eight-dollar-popup-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/home-hero.png)

## Who

I keep a private GitHub org full of product shells. Some are real apps. Some are landers that talk like apps.

For operators who need the honest split between a **$8/mo popup marketing site** and a claimed \`app.\` / CDN product that is not in this repo — and who should not mix this up with the email or helpdesk \`$8\` landers in the same org.

## What

I built **hustleconvert-com** — private \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustleconvert-com\`. Next.js marketing shell. HEAD \`a5d3f13\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. package name \`hustleconvert.com@0.1.0\`. README is stock create-next-app.

Stack facts from \`package.json\`: Next **16.2.6**, React **19.2.6**, Tailwind **^4.3.0**, Bun lockfile. Dependencies stop there — no Clerk, no Convex, no Stripe package, no popup runtime SDK.

What the UI claims:

- Hero: “Popups that **don’t annoy**.” Badge: **Now with A/B testing.** CTAs to \`https://app.hustleconvert.com/signup\` and \`/templates\`.
- Trial strip: **14-day free trial · No credit card required**.

- Competitor table: OptinMonster \`$20+/mo\`, Sumo \`$49+/mo\`, HustleConvert **\`$8/mo\`** with “Unlimited Popups” + “No Branding” checked.
- Pricing: **Free** (1 campaign / 1,000 impressions), **Pro $8/mo**, **Team $24/mo**. Annual Pro copy: **$80/year**.
- FAQ text says Stripe (+ Team invoicing) — still no Stripe in deps.
- Brand: Tailwind \`brand.500 = #0ea5e9\`, \`accent.500 = #8b5cf6\`.
- Docs “Quick Install” snippet points at \`https://cdn.hustleconvert.com/v1/hc.min.js\`.

![Commit arc](/blog/hustleconvert-com-eight-dollar-popup-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because a lander that prices against OptinMonster still needs a resolvable product surface before it is a product story. Because \`app.\` and \`cdn.\` strings in JSX are not a shipped runtime. Because NXDOMAIN is a cleaner failure mode than a parked WordPress front page — and still not a launch.

**Engagement Q:** How many of your “$8/mo SaaS” repos are four marketing pages pointing at an NXDOMAIN \`app.\` subdomain?

## Who

I keep a private GitHub org full of product shells. Some are real apps. Some are landers that talk like apps. Some claim a domain that answers something else entirely.

For operators who need the honest split between a **$8/user CRM marketing site** and the **legacy PHP Bootstrap login** currently living at hustlecrm.com.

## What

I built **hustlecrm-com** — private \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlecrm-com\`. Next.js marketing shell. HEAD \`2c50bbb\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. package name \`hustlecrm.com@0.1.0\`. README is **stock** create-next-app boilerplate.

Stack facts from \`package.json\`: Next **16.2.6**, React **19.2.6**, Tailwind **^4.3.0**, Bun lockfile. Dependencies stop there — no Clerk, no Convex, no Stripe package, no CRM/database library.

What the UI claims:

- Hero: “CRM for People Who **Hate CRMs**.” Subhead close deals. Price line **Simple. Fast. $8/mo.**
- CTAs: **Start Free Trial** → \`href="#"\`, **See Features** → \`/features\`. Header **Sign in** → \`href="#"\`.
- Home **KanbanDemo**: Lead → Contacted → Proposal → Negotiation → Won — Sarah Chen / Emma Wilson / David Kim deal cards with drag-drop — chrome UI, not a product screenshot.
- Feature grid: Contact & Company Management, Deal Pipeline (Kanban), Activity Timeline, Custom Fields, Import & Export, Integrations (HustleChat / HustleForms).
- Competitor cards: HubSpot \`$45+/mo\`, Pipedrive \`$14+/mo\` vs HustleCRM **\`$8/mo\`** — **per user**, cancel anytime.
- Pricing: **Free Trial** $0 / 14 days + **Pro** **$8 /user/month**; table adds Salesforce \`$25+/mo\`.
- Brand blue: CSS \`--primary = #2563eb\` / \`--primary-dark = #1d4ed8\`.

![Pricing Pro $8/user](/blog/hustlecrm-com-eight-per-user-crm-lander-legacy-php-domain/screenshots/pricing-pro.png)

![Competitor table](/blog/hustlecrm-com-eight-per-user-crm-lander-legacy-php-domain/screenshots/competitor-table.png)

Real \`page.tsx\` routes: \`/\`, \`/features\`, \`/pricing\`, \`/docs\`.

Linked but **dead in-repo**: **25** \`href="#"\` hits across header, footer, home, pricing, features, docs (Sign in, trial, Changelog, Privacy, Terms, every docs child, API docs, support). No \`/privacy\` or \`/terms\` pages. Docs shows REST endpoint cards (\`/api/v1/contacts\`, \`/api/v1/deals\`, …) with no backend.

![Docs dead hash links](/blog/hustlecrm-com-eight-per-user-crm-lander-legacy-php-domain/screenshots/docs-dead-links.png)

![Missing routes + PHP domain](/blog/hustlecrm-com-eight-per-user-crm-lander-legacy-php-domain/screenshots/missing-routes.png)

This is **not** \`hustledesk-com\` — that sibling is the **helpdesk** $8 **flat** lander (sky \`#0ea5e9\`, Zendesk comparison, auth → \`app.*\` → WordPress parking). Different product claim. Different brand. Different domain failure mode.

This is **not** \`hustlemail-com\` — that sibling is the **email-marketing** $8 lander (red \`#ef4444\`, Free/$8/$24).

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlecrm-com](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustlecrm-com) — private.

Live probes at pack time:

- \`hustlecrm.com\` DNS A → **162.144.3.43**; HTTPS **200** Apache + \`PHPSESSID\`; title **Hustle CRM!**; Bootstrap **5.3** form \`POST scripts/login.php\` → **302** \`index.php?error=no\`; \`assets/cover.jpg\` Last-Modified **2023-04-17** — **not** this Next CRM lander
- \`www.hustlecrm.com\` → same A / same PHP login
- \`app.hustlecrm.com\` → **NXDOMAIN**
- \`hustlecrm-com.vercel.app\` / \`hustlecrm.vercel.app\` → **404** \`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND\`

Local inspect clone: \`/tmp/cf-inspect/hustlecrm-com\` @ \`2c50bbb\`.

## When

**2026-02-18 07:53 ET** — \`f4494f2\` feat: initial hustlecrm.com marketing site (+2566 / 23 files).  
**2026-06-22 17:12 ET** — \`208c547\` nightly (Fallow hooks, AGENTS.md, REVIEW.md, \`.uncap\`, dep bumps).  
**2026-06-22 18:11 ET** — \`2c50bbb\` nightly empty tip (HEAD).

![Commit arc](/blog/hustlecrm-com-eight-per-user-crm-lander-legacy-php-domain/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because a HubSpot-price lander still needs an auth surface that is not \`href="#"\` while the public domain serves a 2023 PHP login. Because “$8 per user, all features included” on a four-page private repo is table copy, not a billed product. Because hustledesk-com already told the $8 lander story for **helpdesk + WordPress parking** — this pack is the **CRM** twin with **per-user** pricing and a **legacy PHP** domain.

**Engagement Q:** How many of your SaaS domains currently serve a Bootstrap PHP login from 2023 while the Next marketing shell never shipped and every “Start Free Trial” button is a hash?

const HUSTLEFORMS_CONTENT = `![Home hero](/blog/hustleforms-com-eight-dollar-crm-form-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/home-hero.png)

## Who

I keep a private GitHub org full of product shells. Some are real apps. Some are landers that talk like apps.

For operators who need the honest split between a **$8/mo form-builder marketing site** and a claimed CRM/embed product that is not in this repo — and who should not mix this up with the popup, email, or helpdesk \`$8\` landers in the same org.

## What

I built **hustleforms-com** — private \`https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustleforms-com\`. Next.js marketing shell. HEAD \`80c54f4\`. **3** commits. 0 stars. package name \`hustleforms.com@0.1.0\`. README is stock create-next-app.

Stack facts from \`package.json\`: Next **16.2.6**, React **19.2.6**, Tailwind **^4.3.0**, Bun lockfile. Dependencies stop there — no Clerk, no Convex, no Stripe package, no form runtime SDK, no HubSpot/Salesforce client.

What the UI claims:

- Hero: “Forms that feed **your CRM**.” Badge: **Now with AI-powered form suggestions.** CTAs to \`/signup\` and \`/templates\`.
- Strip: **No credit card required • Free plan available**.
- Features: drag-and-drop builder, conditional logic, file uploads, embed anywhere, webhooks, **Direct CRM Sync** (HubSpot / Salesforce / Pipedrive).
- Home competitor cards: Typeform \`$29+\`, Jotform \`$34+\`, Wufoo \`$19+\`, HustleForms **\`$8\`** “BEST VALUE”.
- Pricing table: Unlimited forms / 10,000 submissions / CRM / remove branding at **$8/mo** vs Typeform \`$29\` / Jotform \`$34\`.
- Pricing plans: **Free** (3 forms / 100 submissions), **Pro $8/mo**, **Business $24/mo** (SSO/SAML, API, custom domains). Annual FAQ: **20% off** → \`$6.40\` / \`$19.20\`.
- FAQ text claims HubSpot/Salesforce/Pipedrive/Zoho + webhooks + 14-day trial — still no CRM or Stripe packages.
- Brand: Tailwind \`brand.500 = #0ea5e9\`, \`accent.500 = #8b5cf6\` (same sky+violet tokens as hustleconvert-com).
- Docs embed snippet: \`\` <script src="https://hustleforms.com/embed/YOUR_FORM_ID.js"></script> \`\`.

![Pricing plans](/blog/hustleforms-com-eight-dollar-crm-form-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/pricing-plans.png)

![Competitor table](/blog/hustleforms-com-eight-dollar-crm-form-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/competitor-table.png)

Real \`page.tsx\` routes: \`/\`, \`/pricing\`, \`/templates\`, \`/docs\`.

Linked but **missing**: \`/signup\`, \`/login\`, \`/contact\`, and footer \`#\` stubs (Integrations, Blog, Changelog, About, Privacy, Terms, API Reference). \`/docs\` is a single page of **hash-anchor** cards — not separate child routes — plus resource links that are literally \`href="#"\`. Auth is **not** externalized to \`app.hustleforms.com\` (that subdomain is also NXDOMAIN); it is simply a local route that was never added.

![Docs hash anchors](/blog/hustleforms-com-eight-dollar-crm-form-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/docs-hash-anchors.png)

![Missing routes](/blog/hustleforms-com-eight-dollar-crm-form-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/missing-routes.png)

This is **not** \`hustleconvert-com\` (popups vs OptinMonster), **not** \`hustlemail-com\` (email), and **not** \`hustledesk-com\` (helpdesk). Same \`$8\` lander family. Different category.

## Where

Code: [github.com/michaelmonetized/hustleforms-com](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/hustleforms-com) — private.

Live probes at pack time:

- \`hustleforms-com.vercel.app\` / \`hustleforms.vercel.app\` → **404** \`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND\`
- \`hustleforms.com\` → **NXDOMAIN** (no A/AAAA)
- \`www.hustleforms.com\` / \`app.hustleforms.com\` / \`cdn.hustleforms.com\` → **NXDOMAIN**

Local inspect clone: \`/tmp/cf-inspect/hustleforms-com\` @ \`80c54f4\`.

## When

**2026-02-18 07:53 ET** — \`a516ca1\` feat: initial hustleforms.com marketing site (+2486 / 24 files).  
**2026-06-22 17:11 ET** — \`7b5aeb9\` nightly (Fallow hooks, AGENTS.md, REVIEW.md, \`.uncap\`, dep bumps).  
**2026-06-22 18:10 ET** — \`80c54f4\` nightly empty tip (HEAD).

![Commit arc](/blog/hustleforms-com-eight-dollar-crm-form-lander-nxdomain/screenshots/commit-arc.png)

## Why

Because a lander that prices against Typeform still needs a resolvable product surface before it is a product story. Because HubSpot/Salesforce strings in JSX and an embed script on an NXDOMAIN apex are not a shipped runtime. Because relative \`/signup\` with no \`page.tsx\` is a quieter failure mode than an \`app.\` subdomain — and still not a launch.

**Engagement Q:** How many of your “forms that feed your CRM” repos are four marketing pages where Start Free points at a route that does not exist?
